  {"id":"abbas2024","abstract":"While the discussion on generative artificial intelligence, such as ChatGPT, is making waves in academia and the popular press, there is a need for more insight into the use of ChatGPT among students and the potential harmful or beneficial consequences associated with its usage. Using samples from two studies, the current research examined the causes and consequences of ChatGPT usage among university students. Study 1 developed and validated an eight-item scale to measure ChatGPT usage by conducting a survey among university students (N = 165). Study 2 used a three-wave time-lagged design to collect data from university students (N = 494) to further validate the scale and test the study’s hypotheses. Study 2 also examined the effects of academic workload, academic time pressure, sensitivity to rewards, and sensitivity to quality on ChatGPT usage. Study 2 further examined the  effects of ChatGPT usage on students’ levels of procrastination, memory loss, and academic performance. Study 1 provided evidence for the validity and reliability of the ChatGPT usage scale. Furthermore, study 2 revealed that when students faced higher academic workload and time pressure, they were more likely to use ChatGPT. In contrast, students who were sensitive to rewards were less likely to use ChatGPT. Not surprisingly, use of ChatGPT was likely to develop tendencies for procrastination and memory loss and dampen the students’ academic performance. Finally, academic workload, time pressure, and sensitivity to rewards had indirect effects on students’ outcomes through ChatGPT usage.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Abbas","given":"Muhammad"},{"family":"Jam","given":"Farooq Ahmed"},{"family":"Khan","given":"Tariq Iqbal"}],"citation-key":"abbas2024","container-title":"International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education","container-title-short":"Int J Educ Technol High Educ","DOI":"10.1186/s41239-024-00444-7","ISSN":"2365-9440","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,16]]},"language":"en","page":"10","source":"Springer Link","title":"Is it harmful or helpful?

  {"id":"abdaljaleel2024","abstract":"Artificial intelligence models, like ChatGPT, have the potential to revolutionize higher education when implemented properly. This study aimed to investigate the factors influencing university students’ attitudes and usage of ChatGPT in Arab countries. The survey instrument “TAME-ChatGPT” was administered to 2240 participants from Iraq, Kuwait, Egypt, Lebanon, and Jordan. Of those, 46.8% heard of ChatGPT, and 52.6% used it before the study. The results indicated that a positive attitude and usage of ChatGPT were determined by factors like ease of use, positive attitude towards technology, social influence, perceived usefulness, behavioral/cognitive influences, low perceived risks, and low anxiety. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated the adequacy of the “TAME-ChatGPT” constructs. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the attitude towards ChatGPT usage was significantly influenced by country of residence, age, university type, and recent academic performance. This study validated “TAME-ChatGPT” as a useful tool for assessing ChatGPT adoption among university students. The successful integration of ChatGPT in higher education relies on the perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, positive attitude towards technology, social influence, behavioral/cognitive elements, low anxiety, and minimal perceived risks. Policies for ChatGPT adoption in higher education should be tailored to individual contexts, considering the variations in student attitudes observed in this study.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Abdaljaleel","given":"Maram"},{"family":"Barakat","given":"Muna"},{"family":"Alsanafi","given":"Mariam"},{"family":"Salim","given":"Nesreen A."},{"family":"Abazid","given":"Husam"},{"family":"Malaeb","given":"Diana"},{"family":"Mohammed","given":"Ali Haider"},{"family":"Hassan","given":"Bassam Abdul Rasool"},{"family":"Wayyes","given":"Abdulrasool M."},{"family":"Farhan","given":"Sinan Subhi"},{"family":"Khatib","given":"Sami El"},{"family":"Rahal","given":"Mohamad"},{"family":"Sahban","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Abdelaziz","given":"Doaa H."},{"family":"Mansour","given":"Noha O."},{"family":"AlZayer","given":"Reem"},{"family":"Khalil","given":"Roaa"},{"family":"Fekih-Romdhane","given":"Feten"},{"family":"Hallit","given":"Rabih"},{"family":"Hallit","given":"Souheil"},{"family":"Sallam","given":"Malik"}],"citation-key":"abdaljaleel2024","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-024-52549-8","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,23]]},"language":"en","license":"2024 The Author(s)","note":"76 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09]\n76 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-07]","page":"1983","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"A multinational study on the factors influencing university students’ attitudes and usage of ChatGPT","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-52549-8","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"acemoglu2019","abstract":"We present a framework for understanding the effects of automation and other types of technological changes on labor demand, and use it to interpret changes in US \nemployment over the recent past. At the center of our framework is the allocation of tasks to capital and labor—the task content of production. Automation, which \nenables capital to replace labor in tasks it was previously engaged in, shifts the task content of production against labor because of a displacement effect. As a result, \nautomation always reduces the labor share in value added and may reduce labor demand even as it raises productivity. The effects of automation are counterbalanced \nby the creation of new tasks in which labor has a comparative advantage. The introduction of new tasks changes the task content of production in favor of labor because \nof a reinstatement effect, and always raises the labor share and labor demand. We show how the role of changes in the task content of production—due to automation \nand new tasks—can be inferred from industry-level data. Our empirical decomposition suggests that the slower growth of employment over the last three decades is \naccounted for by an acceleration in the displacement effect, especially in manufacturing, a weaker reinstatement effect, and slower growth of productivity than in \nprevious decades.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Acemoglu","given":"Daron"},{"family":"Restrepo","given":"Pascual"}],"citation-key":"acemoglu2019","container-title":"Journal of Economic Perspectives","DOI":"10.1257/jep.33.2.3","ISSN":"0895-3309","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5]]},"language":"en","note":"1166 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-01]","page":"3–30","source":"www.aeaweb.org","title":"Automation and New Tasks: How Technology Displaces and Reinstates Labor","title-short":"Automation and New Tasks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.33.2.3","volume":"33"},

However, despite its potential, ChatGPT is relatively new. There are limited studies that have investigated its usage readiness, and perceived usefulness among students for academic purposes. This study investigated university students’ academic help-seeking behaviour, with a particular focus on their readiness, and perceived usefulness in using ChatGPT for academic purposes. The study employed a sequential explanatory mixed-method research design. Data were gathered from a total of 373 students from a public university in Malaysia. SPSS software version 27 was used to determine the reliability of the research instrument, and descriptive statistics was used to assess the students’ readiness, and perceived usefulness of ChatGPT for academic purposes. Responses in the open-ended questions were analysed using a four-step approach with ATLAS.ti 22. Research data from both the quantitative and qualitative methods were integrated. Findings indicated that students have the proficiency, willingness, and the requisite technological infrastructure to use ChatGPT, with a large majority attesting to its ability to augment their learning experience. The findings also showed students’ positive perception of ChatGPT’s usefulness in facilitating task and assignment completions, and its resourcefulness in locating learning materials. The results of this study provide practical implications for university policies, and instructor adoption practices on the utilisation of ChatGPT, and other AI technologies, in academic settings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Adams","given":"Donnie"},{"family":"Chuah","given":"Kee-Man"},{"family":"Devadason","given":"Edward"},{"family":"Azzis","given":"Muhammad Shamshinor Abdul"}],"citation-key":"adams2024","container-title":"Education and Information Technologies","container-title-short":"Educ Inf Technol","DOI":"10.1007/s10639-023-12427-8","ISSN":"1573-7608","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,1]]},"language":"en","note":"17 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09]\n16 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-01]","page":"13617–13634","source":"Springer Link","title":"From novice to navigator: Students’ academic help-seeking behaviour, readiness, and perceived usefulness of ChatGPT in learning","title-short":"From novice to navigator","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-023-12427-8","volume":"29"},

The Transformer outperforms the Google Neural Machine Translation model in specific tasks. The biggest benefit, however, comes from how The Transformer lends itself to parallelization. It is in fact Google Cloud’s recommendation to use The Transformer as a reference model to use their Cloud TPU offering. So let’s try to break the model apart and look at how it functions.\n\nThe Transformer was proposed in the paper Attention is All You Need. A TensorFlow implementation of it is available as a part of the Tensor2Tensor package. Harvard’s NLP group created a guide annotating the paper with PyTorch implementation.

  {"id":"ali2024","abstract":"With the continuous intervention of AI tools in the education sector, new research is required to evaluate the viability and feasibility of extant AI platforms to inform various pedagogical methods of instruction. The current manuscript explores the cumulative published literature to date in order to evaluate the key challenges that influence the implications of adopting AI models in the Education Sector. The researchers' present works both in favour and against AI-based applications within the Academic milieu. A total of 69 articles from a 618-article population was selected from diverse academic journals between 2018 and 2023. After a careful review of selected articles, the manuscript presents a classification structure based on five distinct dimensions: user, operational, environmental, technological, and ethical challenges. The current review recommends the use of ChatGPT as a complementary teaching-learning aid including the need to afford customized and optimized versions of the tool for the teaching fraternity. The study addresses an important knowledge gap as to how AI models enhance knowledge within educational settings. For instance, the review discusses interalia a range of AI-related effects on learning from the need for creative prompts, training on diverse datasets and genres, incorporation of human input and data confidentiality and elimination of bias. The study concludes by recommending strategic solutions to the emerging challenges identified while summarizing ways to encourage wider adoption of ChatGPT and other AI tools within the education sector. The insights presented in this review can act as a reference for policymakers, teachers, technology experts and stakeholders, and facilitate the means for wider adoption of ChatGPT in the Education sector more generally. Moreover, the review provides an important foundation for future research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Ali","given":"Omar"},{"family":"Murray","given":"Peter A."},{"family":"Momin","given":"Mujtaba"},{"family":"Dwivedi","given":"Yogesh K."},{"family":"Malik","given":"Tegwen"}],"citation-key":"ali2024","container-title":"Technological Forecasting and Social Change","container-title-short":"Technological Forecasting and Social Change","DOI":"10.1016/j.techfore.2023.123076","ISSN":"0040-1625","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,1]]},"note":"54 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-02]","page":"123076","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The effects of artificial intelligence applications in educational settings: Challenges and strategies","title-short":"The effects of artificial intelligence applications in educational settings","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162523007618","volume":"199"},

  {"id":"an2025","abstract":"This study examined the guidelines issued by the top 50 U.S. universities regarding the use of Generative AI (GenAI) in academic and administrative activities. Employing a mixed methods approach, the research combined topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and qualitative thematic analysis to provide a comprehensive understanding of institutional responses to GenAI. Topic modeling identified four core topics: Integration of GenAI in Learning and Assessment, GenAI in Visual and Multimodal Media, Security and Ethical Considerations in GenAI, and GenAI in Academic Integrity. These themes were further explored through sentiment analysis, which revealed highly positive attitudes towards GenAI across all institution types, with significant differences between faculty and student-targeted guidelines. Qualitative thematic analysis corroborated these findings and provided deeper insights, revealing that 94% of universities had faculty guidelines emphasizing the importance of establishing and communicating course-specific GenAI policies.

  {"id":"aryadoust2024","abstract":"To address the complexity and high costs of developing listening tests for test-takers of varying proficiency levels, this study investigates the capabilities of an OpenAI's large language model, ChatGPT 4, in developing listening assessments. Employing prompt engineering and fine-tuning of prompts, the study specifically focuses on creating listening scripts and test items using ChatGPT 4 for test-takers across a spectrum of proficiency levels (academic, low, intermediate, and advanced). For comparability, the 24 topics of these scripts were selected from topics found in academic listening tests. We conducted two types of analyses to evaluate the quality of the output. First, we performed linguistic analyses of the scripts using Coh-Metrix and Text Inspector to determine if the scripts varied linguistically as required by the prompts. Second, we analyzed topic variation and the degree of overlap in the test items. Results indicated that while ChatGPT 4 reliably produced scripts with significant textual variations, the test items generated were often long and exhibited semantic overlaps among options. This effect was also influenced by the topic. We discuss the ethical complexities that arise from the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI), and how generative AI (GenAI) can potentially benefit practitioners and researchers in language assessment, while recognizing its limitations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Aryadoust","given":"Vahid"},{"family":"Zakaria","given":"Azrifah"},{"family":"Jia","given":"Yichen"}],"citation-key":"aryadoust2024","container-title":"Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence","container-title-short":"Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence","DOI":"10.1016/j.caeai.2024.100204","ISSN":"2666-920X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,1]]},"note":"10 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09]\n10 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-07]","page":"100204","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Investigating the affordances of OpenAI's large language model in developing listening assessments","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X24000055","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"autor2024a","abstract":"While the utopian vision of the current Information Age was that computerization would flatten economic hierarchies by democratizing information, the opposite has occurred. Information, it turns out, is merely an input into a more consequential economic function, decision-making, which is the province of elite experts. The unique opportunity that AI offers to the labor market is to extend the relevance, reach, and value of human expertise. Because of AI’s capacity to weave information and rules with acquired experience to support decision-making, it can be applied to enable a larger set of workers possessing complementary knowledge to perform some of the higher-stakes decision-making tasks that are currently arrogated to elite experts, e.g., medical care to doctors, document production to lawyers, software coding to computer engineers, and undergraduate education to professors. My thesis is not a forecast but an argument about what is possible: AI, if used well, can assist with restoring the middle-skill, middle-class heart of the US labor market that has been hollowed out by automation and globalization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Autor","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"autor2024a","collection-title":"Working Paper Series","DOI":"10.3386/w32140","genre":"Working Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2]]},"number":"32140","publisher":"National Bureau of Economic Research","source":"National Bureau of Economic Research","title":"Applying AI to Rebuild Middle Class Jobs","type":"article","URL":"https://www.nber.org/papers/w32140"},

  {"id":"battle2024","abstract":"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving and basic mathematics abilities. However, their efficacy is highly contingent on the formulation of the prompt. This study endeavors to quantify the influence of incorporating \"positive thinking\" into the system message of the prompt, then compare that to systematic prompt optimization. We assess the performance of 60 combinations of system message snippets, tested with and without Chain of Thought prompting, across three models with parameters ranging from 7 to 70 billion on the GSM8K dataset. Our findings reveal that results do not universally generalize across models. In most instances, the inclusion of \"positive thinking\" prompts positively affected model performance. Notably, however, Llama2-70B exhibited an exception when not utilizing Chain of Thought, as the optimal system message was found to be none at all. Given the combinatorial complexity, and thus computation time, of experimenting with hand-tuning prompts for large black-box models, we then compared the performance of the best \"positive thinking\" prompt against the output of systematic prompt optimization. We show that employing an automated prompt optimizer emerges as the most effective method for enhancing performance, even when working with smaller open-source models. Additionally, our findings reveal that the highest-scoring, automatically-optimized prompt exhibits a degree of peculiarity far beyond expectations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Battle","given":"Rick"},{"family":"Gollapudi","given":"Teja"}],"citation-key":"battle2024","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2402.10949","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,20]]},"note":"8 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-02]\n8 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-01]","number":"arXiv:2402.10949","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Eccentric Automatic Prompts","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10949"},

  {"id":"bubeck2023","abstract":"Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have been developing and refining large language models (LLMs) that exhibit remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and cognition. The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Bubeck","given":"Sébastien"},{"family":"Chandrasekaran","given":"Varun"},{"family":"Eldan","given":"Ronen"},{"family":"Gehrke","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Horvitz","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Kamar","given":"Ece"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Yin Tat"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yuanzhi"},{"family":"Lundberg","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Nori","given":"Harsha"},{"family":"Palangi","given":"Hamid"},{"family":"Ribeiro","given":"Marco Tulio"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yi"}],"citation-key":"bubeck2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2303.12712","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,13]]},"note":"2846 citations (Semantic Scholar/arXiv) [2025-04-23]","number":"arXiv:2303.12712","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4","title-short":"Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712"},

  {"id":"cambra-fierro2025","abstract":"Rapid technological advancements of recent decades have fueled, among other aspects, a global boom in the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) tools across a variety of areas. Higher education, like other domains, has embraced these innovations, with ChatGPT emerging as one of the latest additions. Faculty perception, ability, and willingness to adopt these new tools remain fundamental factors in understanding their proliferation and adoption. However, it’s equally important to strike a balance between reaping the benefits of technology and safeguarding the well-being of faculty members. Against this backdrop, this study assesses the impact of a series of factors on ChatGPT adoption among university faculty members, taking as reference the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Additionally, we analyze the impact of ChatGPT adoption on faculty well-being. All hypotheses are tested using covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM). The findings highlight the positive influence of perceived usefulness, ease of use and enjoyment on ChatGPT adoption. Moreover, ChatGPT adoption seems to boost faculty’ happiness and energy, while diminishing their stress levels. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed in the last section.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Cambra-Fierro","given":"Jesús J."},{"family":"Blasco","given":"María Fuentes"},{"family":"López-Pérez","given":"María-Eugenia Eugenia"},{"family":"Trifu","given":"Andreea"}],"citation-key":"cambra-fierro2025","container-title":"Education and Information Technologies","container-title-short":"Educ Inf Technol","DOI":"10.1007/s10639-024-12871-0","ISSN":"1573-7608","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1517–1538","source":"Springer Link","title":"ChatGPT adoption and its influence on faculty well-being: An empirical research in higher education","title-short":"ChatGPT adoption and its influence on faculty well-being","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-024-12871-0","volume":"30"},
  {"id":"cannas2023","abstract":"Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly considered a source of competitive advantage in operations and supply chain management (OSCM). However, many organisations still struggle to adopt it successfully and empirical studies providing clear indications are scarce in the literature. This research aims to shed light on how AI applications can support OSCM processes and to identify benefits and barriers to their implementation. To this end, it conducts a multiple case study with semi-structured interviews in six companies, totalling 17 implementation cases. The Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model guided the entire study and the analysis of the results by targeting specific processes. The results highlighted how AI methods in OSCM can increase the companies’ competitiveness by reducing costs and lead times and improving service levels, quality, safety, and sustainability. However, they also identify barriers in the implementation of AI, such as ensuring data quality, lack of specific skills, need for high investments, lack of clarity on economic benefits and lack of experience in cost analysis for AI projects. Although the nature of the study is not suitable for wide generalisation, it offers clear guidance for practitioners facing AI dilemmas in specific SCOR processes and provides the basis for further future research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Cannas","given":"Violetta Giada"},{"family":"Ciano","given":"Maria Pia"},{"family":"Saltalamacchia","given":"Mattia"},{"family":"Secchi","given":"Raffaele"}],"citation-key":"cannas2023","container-title":"International Journal of Production Research","DOI":"10.1080/00207543.2023.2232050","ISSN":"0020-7543","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"note":"56 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09]\n56 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-02]\n56 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-01]","page":"1–28","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Artificial intelligence in supply chain and operations management: a multiple case study research","title-short":"Artificial intelligence in supply chain and operations management","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2023.2232050","volume":"0"},

We developed assignments for brainstorming research questions, writing counterarguments, and editing assistance using the AI tools Elicit, Fermat, and Wordtune. Students felt that the tools were helpful for finding ideas to get started with writing, to find sources once they had started writing, and to get help with counterarguments and alternate word choices. But when given the choice to use the assistants or not, most declined. Generative AI at this stage is unreliable, and many students found the tradeoff in reviewing AI suggestions to be too time consuming. And many students expressed a preference for continuing to develop their own voices through writing.

Virtual agents, when powered by artificial intelligence (AI), can be used to scaffold personalized and adaptive learning processes. However, a synthesis or a systematic evaluation of the learning effectiveness of AI-powered virtual agents in computer-based simulations for learning is still lacking. Therefore, this meta-analysis is aimed at evaluating the effects of AI-powered virtual agents in computer-based simulations for learning. The analysis of 49 effect sizes derived from 22 empirical studies suggested a medium positive overall effect, $$\\overline{g }=0.43$$, SE = 0.08, 95% C.I. [0.27, 0.59], favoring the use of AI-powered virtual agents over the non-AI-powered virtual agent condition in computer-based simulations for learning. Further, moderator analyses revealed that intervention length, AI technologies, and the representation of AI-powered virtual agents significantly explain the heterogeneity of the overall effects. Conversely, other moderators, including education level, domain, the role of AI-powered virtual agents, the modality of AI-powered virtual agents, and learning environment, appeared to be universally effective among the studies of AI-powered virtual agents in computer-based simulations for learning. Overall, this meta-analysis provides systematic and existing evidence supporting the adoption of AI-powered virtual agents in computer-based simulations for learning. The findings also inform about evidence-based design decisions on the moderators analyzed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Dai","given":"Chih-Pu"},{"family":"Ke","given":"Fengfeng"},{"family":"Pan","given":"Yanjun"},{"family":"Moon","given":"Jewoong"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Zhichun"}],"citation-key":"dai2024","container-title":"Educational Psychology Review","container-title-short":"Educ Psychol Rev","DOI":"10.1007/s10648-024-09855-4","ISSN":"1573-336X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"31","source":"Springer Link","title":"Effects of Artificial Intelligence-Powered Virtual Agents on Learning Outcomes in Computer-Based Simulations: A Meta-Analysis","title-short":"Effects of Artificial Intelligence-Powered Virtual Agents on Learning Outcomes in Computer-Based Simulations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10648-024-09855-4","volume":"36"},

  {"id":"dunlosky2013","abstract":"Many students are being left behind by an educational system that some people believe is in crisis. Improving educational outcomes will require efforts on many fronts, but a central premise of this monograph is that one part of a solution involves helping students to better regulate their learning through the use of effective learning techniques. Fortunately, cognitive and educational psychologists have been developing and evaluating easy-to-use learning techniques that could help students achieve their learning goals. In this monograph, we discuss 10 learning techniques in detail and offer recommendations about their relative utility. We selected techniques that were expected to be relatively easy to use and hence could be adopted by many students. Also, some techniques (e.g., highlighting and rereading) were selected because students report relying heavily on them, which makes it especially important to examine how well they work. The techniques include elaborative interrogation, self-explanation, summarization, highlighting (or underlining), the keyword mnemonic, imagery use for text learning, rereading, practice testing, distributed practice, and interleaved practice. To offer recommendations about the relative utility of these techniques, we evaluated whether their benefits generalize across four categories of variables: learning conditions, student characteristics, materials, and criterion tasks. Learning conditions include aspects of the learning environment in which the technique is implemented, such as whether a student studies alone or with a group. Student characteristics include variables such as age, ability, and level of prior knowledge. Materials vary from simple concepts to mathematical problems to complicated science texts. Criterion tasks include different outcome measures that are relevant to student achievement, such as those tapping memory, problem solving, and comprehension. We attempted to provide thorough reviews for each technique, so this monograph is rather lengthy. However, we also wrote the monograph in a modular fashion, so it is easy to use. In particular, each review is divided into the following sections: General description of the technique and why it should work How general are the effects of this technique? 2a. Learning conditions 2b. Student characteristics 2c. Materials 2d. Criterion tasks Effects in representative educational contexts Issues for implementation Overall assessment The review for each technique can be read independently of the others, and particular variables of interest can be easily compared across techniques. To foreshadow our final recommendations, the techniques vary widely with respect to their generalizability and promise for improving student learning. Practice testing and distributed practice received high utility assessments because they benefit learners of different ages and abilities and have been shown to boost students' performance across many criterion tasks and even in educational contexts. Elaborative interrogation, self-explanation, and interleaved practice received moderate utility assessments. The benefits of these techniques do generalize across some variables, yet despite their promise, they fell short of a high utility assessment because the evidence for their efficacy is limited. For instance, elaborative interrogation and self-explanation have not been adequately evaluated in educational contexts, and the benefits of interleaving have just begun to be systematically explored, so the ultimate effectiveness of these techniques is currently unknown. Nevertheless, the techniques that received moderate-utility ratings show enough promise for us to recommend their use in appropriate situations, which we describe in detail within the review of each technique. Five techniques received a low utility assessment: summarization, highlighting, the keyword mnemonic, imagery use for text learning, and rereading. These techniques were rated as low utility for numerous reasons. Summarization and imagery use for text learning have been shown to help some students on some criterion tasks, yet the conditions under which these techniques produce benefits are limited, and much research is still needed to fully explore their overall effectiveness. The keyword mnemonic is difficult to implement in some contexts, and it appears to benefit students for a limited number of materials and for short retention intervals. Most students report rereading and highlighting, yet these techniques do not consistently boost students' performance, so other techniques should be used in their place (e.g., practice testing instead of rereading). Our hope is that this monograph will foster improvements in student learning, not only by showcasing which learning techniques are likely to have the most generalizable effects but also by encouraging researchers to continue investigating the most promising techniques. Accordingly, in our closing remarks, we discuss some issues for how these techniques could be implemented by teachers and students, and we highlight directions for future research.","author":[{"family":"Dunlosky","given":"John"},{"family":"Rawson","given":"Katherine A."},{"family":"Marsh","given":"Elizabeth J."},{"family":"Nathan","given":"Mitchell J."},{"family":"Willingham","given":"Daniel T."}],"citation-key":"dunlosky2013","container-title":"Psychological science in the public interest : a journal of the American Psychological Society","DOI":"10.1177/1529100612453266","ISSN":"1529-1006","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"page":"4–58","title":"Improving Students' Learning With Effective Learning Techniques: Promising Directions From Cognitive and Educational Psychology","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"farazouli","abstract":"The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has given rise to diverse narratives about its transformative potential in higher education. Despite widespread speculation about how GAI might change teaching and learning, there is a significant gap in understanding how GAI artefacts are perceived in educational practices, particularly from the perspective of university teachers. This study investigates how GAI mediates teachers’ practices and reconfigures professional roles. Drawing on post-phenomenology and technological mediation theory, we focus on university teachers’ experiences and perceptions of GAI in higher education. Twenty-four university teachers participated in workshops involving assessment exercises with GAI-generated outputs, followed by focus group interviews discussing the challenges and opportunities posed by GAI. Findings reveal that GAI prompts teachers to reassess established practices, particularly in relation to assessment, while confronting ethical concerns regarding fairness, trust, and quality. Teachers described their initial engagement with GAI as transformative yet challenging, as they navigated uncertainties about their roles while prioritising students’ learning and development. By capturing teachers’ voices during this pivotal period, the study contributes to the growing body of research on AI's role in higher education and provides a nuanced understanding of its impact on teaching and learning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Farazouli","given":"Alexandra"},{"family":"Cerrato Pargman","given":"Teresa"},{"family":"Bolander Laksov","given":"Klara"},{"family":"McGrath","given":"Cormac"}],"citation-key":"farazouli","container-title":"Studies in Higher Education","DOI":"10.1080/03075079.2025.2550766","ISSN":"0307-5079","issue":"0","page":"1–16","publisher":"SRHE Website","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Navigating uncertainty: university teachers’ experiences and perceptions of generative artificial intelligence in teaching and learning","title-short":"Navigating uncertainty","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/03075079.2025.2550766","volume":"0"},

  {"id":"fischer2024","abstract":"At a time when emerging technologies increasingly transform the workplace and society overall, management educators seem reluctant to fully embrace emerging transformative technologies in their teaching. In this conceptual essay, we argue that this reluctance stems from paradoxical tensions of identity of management educators and students. The case is made that, currently, management educators tend to display their expertise to meet students’ reductionist curiosity. We recommend that management educators move beyond an initial reductionist curriculum to harness the opposing forces created by the paradoxical tensions of identity, which means embracing vulnerability at the same time as stimulating students’ expansionist curiosity. Our pedagogic recommendations are based on our experience of integrating generative and non-generative artificial intelligence, as well as esports and virtual reality as a preparation for the metaverse, into our curriculum. The essay concludes by proposing a sequence of three steps that might guide management educators in their preparation to integrate emerging technologies in the classroom in a way that empowers students to envision shaping the unknown future in an innovative and responsible way.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",12,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Fischer","given":"Isabel"},{"family":"Dobbins","given":"Kerry"}],"citation-key":"fischer2024","container-title":"Journal of Management Education","DOI":"10.1177/10525629231201843","ISSN":"1052-5629","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,1]]},"language":"EN","page":"829–848","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Is it Worth it?

  {"id":"fisher","abstract":"This study examines the impact of generative AI (genAI) tools, specifically ChatGPT, on university student creativity across three disciplines: Marketing, Management, and Entrepreneurship. Using a randomised control trial design with 1190 undergraduate students, creativity was evaluated through fluency, originality, and elaboration. Findings reveal the use of ChatGPT had little to no effect for Entrepreneurship students yet tended to enhance creativity for Marketing and, to a lesser extent, Management students. However, its impact on originality was inconsistent, with improvements observed only in Marketing. Entrepreneurship students, with higher baseline creativity and potentially greater intrinsic motivation for the discipline, benefited less from genAI, suggesting a shift in its role from scaffolding tool to collaborative partner or productivity enhancer for students with these characteristics. The results highlight the need for educators to tailor genAI integration to disciplinary contexts and student needs. Additional research is required to explore how pedagogical factors, task and student proclivities shape genAI’s effectiveness in fostering student creativity. Thoughtful integration of genAI requires well-informed educators who are prepared to develop pedagogies that harness AI’s potential to complement human creativity. By fostering creative- and AI self-efficacy such pedagogical approaches can equip students to thrive in the unique demands of today’s AI-driven workforce.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Fisher","given":"Rosemary"},{"family":"Gogan","given":"Taylor"},{"family":"Williams","given":"James"},{"family":"Laferriere","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Campbell","given":"Gordon"},{"family":"Gunasekara","given":"Asanka"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Jeremy"}],"citation-key":"fisher","container-title":"Studies in Higher Education","DOI":"10.1080/03075079.2025.2515512","ISSN":"0307-5079","issue":"0","note":"0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-09-03]","page":"1–15","publisher":"SRHE Website","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Can ChatGPT enhance business student creativity?

We used editable prompt templates and socially-sourced keywords to structure their prompt-crafting process. This design influenced participants’ behaviors towards exploration (to generate novel information landscapes) and exploitation (to dive into specific content). Findings suggest that exploration facilitates navigation of semantically diverse information, especially when influenced by social cues. In contrast, exploitation narrows the focus to using AI-generated content. Participants also completed a Computational Thinking survey: exploratory analyses suggest that trait cooperativity encourages exploitation of AI content, while trait critical thinking moderates reliance on participants’ own interests.

  {"id":"fossowamba2023","abstract":"ChatGPT and generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) are transforming firms and supply chains. However, the empirical literature reporting the benefits, challenges, and outlook of these nascent technologies in operations and supply chain management (OSCM) is limited. This study surveys current projects and perceptions of these technologies in US (n = 119) and UK (n = 181) supply chains. We found that projects range from proof-of-concept to full implementation, with a main focus on operational gains, such as improved customer satisfaction, cost minimisation, and process efficiencies. The main challenges concern data, technological and organisational issues. Expected benefits are dominated by cost savings and enhanced customer experience, but also include increased automation and sustainability. Industries were found to cluster around six groups according to perceived benefits and implementation challenges. Our findings contribute to the emerging literature on Gen-AI use in OSCM, and to management practice by mapping the benefits, challenges, outlook, and maturity level of Gen-AI projects in supply chains.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Fosso Wamba","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Guthrie","given":"Cameron"},{"family":"Queiroz","given":"Maciel M."},{"family":"Minner","given":"Stefan"}],"citation-key":"fossowamba2023","container-title":"International Journal of Production Research","DOI":"10.1080/00207543.2023.2294116","ISSN":"0020-7543","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"note":"37 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-02]\n37 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-01]","page":"1–21","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"ChatGPT and generative artificial intelligence: an exploratory study of key benefits and challenges in operations and supply chain management","title-short":"ChatGPT and generative artificial intelligence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2023.2294116","volume":"0"},

In this article, leading academics, scientists, distinguish researchers and engineers discuss the transformative effects of ChatGPT on modern education. This research discusses ChatGPT capabilities and its use in the education sector, identifies potential concerns and challenges. Our preliminary evaluation shows that ChatGPT perform differently in different subject areas including finance, coding, maths, and general public queries. While ChatGPT has the ability to help educators by creating instructional content, offering suggestions and acting as an online educator to learners by answering questions, transforming education through smartphones and IoT gadgets, and promoting group work, there are clear drawbacks in its use, such as the possibility of producing inaccurate or false data and circumventing duplicate content (plagiarism) detectors where originality is essential. The often reported “hallucinations” within GenerativeAI in general, and also relevant for ChatGPT, can render its use of limited benefit where accuracy is essential. What ChatGPT lacks is a stochastic measure to help provide sincere and sensitive communication with its users. Academic regulations and evaluation practices used in educational institutions need to be updated, should ChatGPT be used as a tool in education.

  {"id":"goh2025","abstract":"While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in diagnostic reasoning, their impact on management reasoning, which involves balancing treatment decisions and testing strategies while managing risk, is unknown. This prospective, randomized, controlled trial assessed whether LLM assistance improves physician performance on open-ended management reasoning tasks compared to conventional resources. From November 2023 to April 2024, 92 practicing physicians were randomized to use either GPT-4 plus conventional resources or conventional resources alone to answer five expert-developed clinical vignettes in a simulated setting. All cases were based on real, de-identified patient encounters, with information revealed sequentially to mirror the nature of clinical environments. The primary outcome was the difference in total score between groups on expert-developed scoring rubrics. Secondary outcomes included domain-specific scores and time spent per case. Physicians using the LLM scored significantly higher compared to those using conventional resources (mean difference = 6.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.7 to 10.2, P < 0.001). LLM users spent more time per case (mean difference = 119.3 s, 95% CI = 17.4 to 221.2, P = 0.02). There was no significant difference between LLM-augmented physicians and LLM alone (−0.9%, 95% CI = −9.0 to 7.2, P = 0.8). LLM assistance can improve physician management reasoning in complex clinical vignettes compared to conventional resources and should be validated in real clinical practice.

  {"id":"gosmar2025","abstract":"Hallucinations remain a significant challenge in current Generative AI models, undermining trust in AI systems and their reliability. This study investigates how orchestrating multiple specialized Artificial Intelligent Agents can help mitigate such hallucinations, with a focus on systems leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) to facilitate seamless agent interactions. To achieve this, we design a pipeline that introduces over three hundred prompts, purposefully crafted to induce hallucinations, into a front-end agent. The outputs are then systematically reviewed and refined by second- and third-level agents, each employing distinct large language models and tailored strategies to detect unverified claims, incorporate explicit disclaimers, and clarify speculative content. Additionally, we introduce a set of novel Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) specifically designed to evaluate hallucination score levels. A dedicated fourth-level AI agent is employed to evaluate these KPIs, providing detailed assessments and ensuring accurate quantification of shifts in hallucination-related behaviors. A core component of this investigation is the use of the OVON (Open Voice Network) framework, which relies on universal NLP-based interfaces to transfer contextual information among agents. Through structured JSON messages, each agent communicates its assessment of the hallucination likelihood and the reasons underlying questionable content, thereby enabling the subsequent stage to refine the text without losing context. The results demonstrate that employing multiple specialized agents capable of interoperating with each other through NLP-based agentic frameworks can yield promising outcomes in hallucination mitigation, ultimately bolstering trust within the AI community.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Gosmar","given":"Diego"},{"family":"Dahl","given":"Deborah A."}],"citation-key":"gosmar2025","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2501.13946","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,19]]},"note":"1 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-15]","number":"arXiv:2501.13946","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Hallucination Mitigation using Agentic AI Natural Language-Based Frameworks","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13946"},
  {"id":"gottweis2025","abstract":"Scientific discovery relies on scientists generating novel hypotheses that undergo rigorous experimental validation. To augment this process, we introduce an AI co-scientist, a multi-agent system built on Gemini 2.0. The AI co-scientist is intended to help uncover new, original knowledge and to formulate demonstrably novel research hypotheses and proposals, building upon prior evidence and aligned to scientist-provided research objectives and guidance. The system's design incorporates a generate, debate, and evolve approach to hypothesis generation, inspired by the scientific method and accelerated by scaling test-time compute. Key contributions include: (1) a multi-agent architecture with an asynchronous task execution framework for flexible compute scaling; (2) a tournament evolution process for self-improving hypotheses generation. Automated evaluations show continued benefits of test-time compute, improving hypothesis quality. While general purpose, we focus development and validation in three biomedical areas: drug repurposing, novel target discovery, and explaining mechanisms of bacterial evolution and anti-microbial resistance. For drug repurposing, the system proposes candidates with promising validation findings, including candidates for acute myeloid leukemia that show tumor inhibition in vitro at clinically applicable concentrations. For novel target discovery, the AI co-scientist proposed new epigenetic targets for liver fibrosis, validated by anti-fibrotic activity and liver cell regeneration in human hepatic organoids. Finally, the AI co-scientist recapitulated unpublished experimental results via a parallel in silico discovery of a novel gene transfer mechanism in bacterial evolution. These results, detailed in separate, co-timed reports, demonstrate the potential to augment biomedical and scientific discovery and usher an era of AI empowered scientists.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Gottweis","given":"Juraj"},{"family":"Weng","given":"Wei-Hung"},{"family":"Daryin","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Tu","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Palepu","given":"Anil"},{"family":"Sirkovic","given":"Petar"},{"family":"Myaskovsky","given":"Artiom"},{"family":"Weissenberger","given":"Felix"},{"family":"Rong","given":"Keran"},{"family":"Tanno","given":"Ryutaro"},{"family":"Saab","given":"Khaled"},{"family":"Popovici","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Blum","given":"Jacob"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Fan"},{"family":"Chou","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Hassidim","given":"Avinatan"},{"family":"Gokturk","given":"Burak"},{"family":"Vahdat","given":"Amin"},{"family":"Kohli","given":"Pushmeet"},{"family":"Matias","given":"Yossi"},{"family":"Carroll","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Kulkarni","given":"Kavita"},{"family":"Tomasev","given":"Nenad"},{"family":"Guan","given":"Yuan"},{"family":"Dhillon","given":"Vikram"},{"family":"Vaishnav","given":"Eeshit Dhaval"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Byron"},{"family":"Costa","given":"Tiago R.

  {"id":"hare2025","abstract":"With increasing interest in computer-assisted educa- tion, AI-integrated systems become highly applicable with their ability to adapt based on user interactions. In this context, this paper focuses on understanding and analysing first-year undergraduate student responses to an intelligent educational system that applies multi-agent reinforcement learning as an AI tutor. With human–computer interaction at the centre, we discuss principles of interface design and educational gamification in the context of multiple years of student observations, student feedback surveys and focus group interviews. We show positive feedback from the design methodology we discuss as well as the overall process of providing automated tutoring in a gamified virtual environment. We also discuss students' thinking in the context of gamified educational systems, as well as unexpected issues that may arise when implementing such systems. Ultimately, our design iterations and analysis both offer new insights for practical implementation of computer-assisted educational systems, focusing on how AI can augment, rather than replace, human intelligence in the classroom. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic AI-integrated systems show promise for personalizing learning and improving student education.

  {"id":"hattie2023","abstract":"\"When the original Visible Learning published in 2008 it instantly became a publishing sensation. Interest in the book was unparalleled; it sold out in days and was described by the TES as revealing 'teaching's Holy Grail'. Now John Hattie returns to this ground-breaking work. The research underlying this book is now informed by more than 2,100 meta-analyses (more than double that of the original), drawn from more than 130,000 studies and involving more than 400 million students from all around the world. But this is more than just a new edition. This book is a sequel that highlights the major story, taking in the big picture to reflect on the implementation in schools of Visible Learning, how it has been understood - and at times misunderstood - and what future directions research should take. Visible Learning: The Sequel reiterates the author's desire to move beyond claiming \"what works\" to \"what works best\" by asking crucial questions such as: Why is the current 'grammar of schooling', so embedded in so many classrooms and can we improve it? Why is the learning curve for teachers after the first few years so flat? How can we develop teacher mind-frames to focus more on learning and listening? How can we incorporate research evidence as part of the discussions within schools? Areas covered include: - The evidence base and reactions to Visible Learning - The Visible Learning model - The intentional alignment of learning and teaching strategies - The influence of home, students, teachers, classrooms, schools, learning and curriculum on achievement - The impact of technology Building upon the success of original, this highly anticipated sequel expands Hattie's model of teaching and learning based on evidence of impact and is essential reading for anyone involved in the field of education either as a researcher, teacher, student, school leader, teacher trainer or policy maker\"--","author":[{"family":"Hattie","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"hattie2023","DOI":"10.4324/9781003380542","edition":"First edition","event-place":"London New York","ISBN":"978-1-003-38054-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"eng","number-of-pages":"1","publisher":"Routledge, Taylor & Francis Group","publisher-place":"London New York","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"Visible learning, the sequel: a synthesis of over 2,100 meta-analyses relating to achievement","title-short":"Visible learning, the sequel","type":"book"},

Two literatures exploring this interaction—human-AI collaboration (HAIC) and algorithmic management (AM)—have focused on distinct managerial tasks: while HAIC examines executive decision-making, AM focuses on managerial control. This article presents a review of both literatures to identify opportunities for integration and advancement. We observe that HAIC’s and AM’s micro-level emphases on different managerial tasks have resulted in diverging conceptualizations of context, agency, interaction, and outcome. Adopting a more encompassing systems lens, we unveil previously concealed linkages between HAIC and AM, suggesting that the two literatures have analyzed two sides of the same phenomenon: while HAIC explores how humans use AI to manage, AM describes how humans are managed by AI. We develop an integrative framework that elevates the viewpoint from tasks to the organizational context, from individual to collective agency, from local to systemic interaction, and from micro-level to multilevel outcomes.

Current research mainly focuses on the use of LLMs to tutor students, while the exploration of LLMs’ potential to assist teachers is limited. Taking high school mathematics as an example, we propose a method that utilizes LLMs to enhance the quality of teaching plans through guiding the LLM to simulate teacher-student interactions, generate teaching reflections, and subsequently direct the LLM to refine the teaching plan by integrating these teaching process and reflections. Human evaluation results show that this method significantly elevates the quality of the original teaching plans generated directly by LLM. The improved teaching plans are comparable to high-quality ones crafted by human teachers across various assessment dimensions and knowledge modules.

  {"id":"huang","abstract":"The burgeoning integration of GenAI within postgraduate education has sparked a growing debate concerning its potential to either enhance postgraduate students’ research creativity or exacerbate their academic plagiarism. Grounded in self-regulation theory, this study sought to investigate the double-edged effects of GenAI usage. This study employed a sequential explanatory mixed method approach, combining a questionnaire survey (n = 1,515) with semi-structured interviews (n = 20) in China. Quantitative results supported a moderated mediation model: GenAI usage’s effect on research creativity (β = 0.171, p < 0.01) and GenAI plagiarism (β = 0.184, p < 0.01) were significantly mediated by research engagement with GenAI, while self-regulated learning moderated these paths differentially – positively for research creativity (β = 0.077, p < 0.01) and negatively for GenAI plagiarism (β = −0.104, p < 0.05). Qualitative findings provided a nuanced understanding of the quantitative results, demonstrating how both the performance-driven academic environment and self-regulated learning capabilities shape postgraduate students’ experiences of research engagement with GenAI and their subsequent influence on research creativity and GenAI plagiarism. This study highlighted how individual and institutional factors influence GenAI plagiarism, emphasizing higher education institutions’ responsibility to guide postgraduate students in using GenAI productively while upholding academic integrity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Huang","given":"Yating"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Keying"},{"family":"Li","given":"Sihui"}],"citation-key":"huang","container-title":"Studies in Higher Education","DOI":"10.1080/03075079.2025.2543438","ISSN":"0307-5079","issue":"0","page":"1–22","publisher":"SRHE Website","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"How postgraduates navigate GenAI’s dual pathways between research creativity and academic plagiarism: research engagement and self-regulated learning matter","title-short":"How postgraduates navigate GenAI’s dual pathways between research creativity and academic plagiarism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/03075079.2025.2543438","volume":"0"},

Two separate cohorts of students were examined. The first larger cohort of students (n = 99) was randomly divided into ‘oral’ and ‘written’ groups, and the marks that they achieved in the same biology questions were compared. Students in the second smaller cohort (n = 29) were all examined using both written and oral questions concerning both ‘scientific’ and ‘personal development’ topics. Both cohorts showed highly significant differences in the mean marks achieved, with better performance in the oral assessment. There was no evidence of particular groups of students being disadvantaged in the oral tests. These students and also an additional cohort were asked about their attitudes to the two different assessment approaches. Although they tended to be more nervous in the face of oral assessments, many students thought oral assessments were more useful than written assessments. An important theme involved the perceived authenticity or ‘professionalism’ of an oral examination. This study suggests that oral assessments may be more inclusive than written ones and that they can act as powerful tools in helping students establish a ‘professional identity’.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Huxham","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Campbell","given":"Fiona"},{"family":"Westwood","given":"Jenny"}],"citation-key":"huxham2012","container-title":"Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education","DOI":"10.1080/02602938.2010.515012","ISSN":"0260-2938","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,1]]},"note":"162 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-08-26]","page":"125–136","publisher":"SRHE Website","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Oral versus written assessments: a test of student performance and attitudes","title-short":"Oral versus written assessments","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/02602938.2010.515012","volume":"37"},

  {"id":"hyde2024","abstract":"This essay examines strategies for thoughtfully integrating generative AI (Gen-AI) into management curricula to enhance student learning while mitigating risks like overreliance. We make the case that outright resistance is counterproductive; instead, management educators should embrace Gen-AI’s potential to create more engaging, experiential learning aligned with andragogical principles. We provide a conceptual framework mapping nine Gen-AI objectives to the principles of andragogy. A semester-long course example illustrates this framework in action through AI activities fostering autonomy, competence, and real-world application. Student surveys revealed overwhelmingly positive perceptions of Gen-AI integration and improved exam scores. However, dependence risks remain. The essay discusses strategies to enhance critical thinking, personal growth, and academic integrity. Overall, we propose that prudent Gen-AI adoption can enrich management education, but long-term vigilance regarding overreliance is vital.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",12,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Hyde","given":"Steven J."},{"family":"Busby","given":"Antoine"},{"family":"Bonner","given":"Robert L."}],"citation-key":"hyde2024","container-title":"Journal of Management Education","DOI":"10.1177/10525629241230357","ISSN":"1052-5629","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,1]]},"language":"EN","page":"708–734","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Tools or Fools: Are We Educating Managers or Creating Tool-Dependent Robots?","title-short":"Tools or Fools","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/10525629241230357","volume":"48"},
  {"id":"ibrahim2023","abstract":"The emergence of large language models has led to the development of powerful tools such as ChatGPT that can produce text indistinguishable from human-generated work. With the increasing accessibility of such technology, students across the globe may utilize it to help with their school work—a possibility that has sparked ample discussion on the integrity of student evaluation processes in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). To date, it is unclear how such tools perform compared to students on university-level courses across various disciplines. Further, students’ perspectives regarding the use of such tools in school work, and educators’ perspectives on treating their use as plagiarism, remain unknown. Here, we compare the performance of the state-of-the-art tool, ChatGPT, against that of students on 32 university-level courses. We also assess the degree to which its use can be detected by two classifiers designed specifically for this purpose. Additionally, we conduct a global survey across five countries, as well as a more in-depth survey at the authors’ institution, to discern students’ and educators’ perceptions of ChatGPT’s use in school work. We find that ChatGPT’s performance is comparable, if not superior, to that of students in a multitude of courses. Moreover, current AI-text classifiers cannot reliably detect ChatGPT’s use in school work, due to both their propensity to classify human-written answers as AI-generated, as well as the relative ease with which AI-generated text can be edited to evade detection. Finally, there seems to be an emerging consensus among students to use the tool, and among educators to treat its use as plagiarism. Our findings offer insights that could guide policy discussions addressing the integration of artificial intelligence into educational frameworks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Ibrahim","given":"Hazem"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Fengyuan"},{"family":"Asim","given":"Rohail"},{"family":"Battu","given":"Balaraju"},{"family":"Benabderrahmane","given":"Sidahmed"},{"family":"Alhafni","given":"Bashar"},{"family":"Adnan","given":"Wifag"},{"family":"Alhanai","given":"Tuka"},{"family":"AlShebli","given":"Bedoor"},{"family":"Baghdadi","given":"Riyadh"},{"family":"Bélanger","given":"Jocelyn J."},{"family":"Beretta","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Celik","given":"Kemal"},{"family":"Chaqfeh","given":"Moumena"},{"family":"Daqaq","given":"Mohammed F."},{"family":"Bernoussi","given":"Zaynab El"},{"family":"Fougnie","given":"Daryl"},{"family":"Garcia de Soto","given":"Borja"},{"family":"Gandolfi","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Gyorgy","given":"Andras"},{"family":"Habash","given":"Nizar"},{"family":"Harris","given":"J.

  {"id":"jonsson2007","abstract":"Several benefits of using scoring rubrics in performance assessments have been proposed, such as increased consistency of scoring, the possibility to facilitate valid judgment of complex competencies, and promotion of learning. This paper investigates whether evidence for these claims can be found in the research literature. Several databases were searched for empirical research on rubrics, resulting in a total of 75 studies relevant for this review. Conclusions are that: (1) the reliable scoring of performance assessments can be enhanced by the use of rubrics, especially if they are analytic, topic-specific, and complemented with exemplars and/or rater training; (2) rubrics do not facilitate valid judgment of performance assessments per se. However, valid assessment could be facilitated by using a more comprehensive framework of validity when validating the rubric; (3) rubrics seem to have the potential of promoting learning and/or improve instruction. The main reason for this potential lies in the fact that rubrics make expectations and criteria explicit, which also facilitates feedback and self-assessment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Jonsson","given":"Anders"},{"family":"Svingby","given":"Gunilla"}],"citation-key":"jonsson2007","container-title":"Educational Research Review","container-title-short":"Educational Research Review","DOI":"10.1016/j.edurev.2007.05.002","ISSN":"1747-938X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",1,1]]},"page":"130–144","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The use of scoring rubrics: Reliability, validity and educational consequences","title-short":"The use of scoring rubrics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1747938X07000188","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"kasneci2023","abstract":"Large language models represent a significant advancement in the field of AI. The underlying technology is key to further innovations and, despite critical views and even bans within communities and regions, large language models are here to stay. This position paper presents the potential benefits and challenges of educational applications of large language models, from student and teacher perspectives. We briefly discuss the current state of large language models and their applications. We then highlight how these models can be used to create educational content, improve student engagement and interaction, and personalize learning experiences. With regard to challenges, we argue that large language models in education require teachers and learners to develop sets of competencies and literacies necessary to both understand the technology as well as their limitations and unexpected brittleness of such systems. In addition, a clear strategy within educational systems and a clear pedagogical approach with a strong focus on critical thinking and strategies for fact checking are required to integrate and take full advantage of large language models in learning settings and teaching \ncurricula. Other challenges such as the potential bias in the output, the need for continuous human oversight, and the potential for misuse are not unique to the application of AI in education. But we believe that, if handled sensibly, these challenges can offer insights and opportunities in education scenarios to acquaint students early on with potential societal biases, criticalities, and risks of AI applications. We conclude with recommendations for how to address these challenges and ensure that such models are used in a responsible and ethical manner in education.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Kasneci","given":"Enkelejda"},{"family":"Seßler","given":"Kathrin"},{"family":"Küchemann","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Bannert","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Dementieva","given":"Daryna"},{"family":"Fischer","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Gasser","given":"Urs"},{"family":"Groh","given":"Georg"},{"family":"Günnemann","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Hüllermeier","given":"Eyke"},{"family":"Krusche","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Kutyniok","given":"Gitta"},{"family":"Michaeli","given":"Tilman"},{"family":"Nerdel","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Pfeffer","given":"Jürgen"},{"family":"Poquet","given":"Oleksandra"},{"family":"Sailer","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Albrecht"},{"family":"Seidel","given":"Tina"},{"family":"Stadler","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Weller","given":"Jochen"},{"family":"Kuhn","given":"Jochen"},{"family":"Kasneci","given":"Gjergji"}],"citation-key":"kasneci2023","DOI":"10.35542/osf.io/5er8f","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,29]]},"language":"en-us","source":"OSF Preprints","title":"ChatGPT for Good?

  {"id":"kazu2025","abstract":"Language learning challenges highlight the need for innovative digital tools like Duolingo to improve proficiency and engagement. Therefore, this study addressed the critical demand for effective language learning tools among 10th grade (14–15 years old) high school students, focusing on the Duolingo website and its impact on four essential language skills. A mixed methods approach was employed, integrating a quasi-experimental design to quantitatively assess Duolingo's impact and a phenomenological design to qualitatively explore metaphorical perceptions and interview results. Additionally, a Repeated Measures ANOVA was used because it allows for comparing the means of the same participants across multiple tests. From a sample of 60 students, 32 were assigned to the experimental group, dedicating at least 1 h per week to learning English on Duolingo over 12 weeks, while the remaining 28 students formed the control group. Pre-tests, post-tests, and delayed tests based on Cambridge’s language skills were given over three months, with the experimental group using Duolingo and the control group using traditional methods. Positive student feedback highlighted Duolingo's engaging, adaptive approach, leading to improvements in listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills in the experimental group. The findings affirmed the effectiveness of digital language learning tools like Duolingo and their potential to complement didactic language learning.

  {"id":"kuznetsov2024","abstract":"The number of scientific articles produced every year is growing rapidly. Providing quality control over them is crucial for scientists and, ultimately, for the public good. In modern science, this process is largely delegated to peer review -- a distributed procedure in which each submission is evaluated by several independent experts in the field. Peer review is widely used, yet it is hard, time-consuming, and prone to error. Since the artifacts involved in peer review -- manuscripts, reviews, discussions -- are largely text-based, Natural Language Processing has great potential to improve reviewing. As the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has enabled NLP assistance for many new tasks, the discussion on machine-assisted peer review is picking up the pace. Yet, where exactly is help needed, where can NLP help, and where should it stand aside? The goal of our paper is to provide a foundation for the future efforts in NLP for peer-reviewing assistance. We discuss peer review as a general process, exemplified by reviewing at AI conferences. We detail each step of the process from manuscript submission to camera-ready revision, and discuss the associated challenges and opportunities for NLP assistance, illustrated by existing work. We then turn to the big challenges in NLP for peer review as a whole, including data acquisition and licensing, operationalization and experimentation, and ethical issues. To help consolidate community efforts, we create a companion repository that aggregates key datasets pertaining to peer review. Finally, we issue a detailed call for action for the scientific community, NLP and AI researchers, policymakers, and funding bodies to help bring the research in NLP for peer review forward. We hope that our work will help set the agenda for research in machine-assisted scientific quality control in the age of AI, within the NLP community and beyond.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Kuznetsov","given":"Ilia"},{"family":"Afzal","given":"Osama Mohammed"},{"family":"Dercksen","given":"Koen"},{"family":"Dycke","given":"Nils"},{"family":"Goldberg","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Hope","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Hovy","given":"Dirk"},{"family":"Kummerfeld","given":"Jonathan K."},{"family":"Lauscher","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Leyton-Brown","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Sheng"},{"literal":"Mausam"},{"family":"Mieskes","given":"Margot"},{"family":"Névéol","given":"Aurélie"},{"family":"Pruthi","given":"Danish"},{"family":"Qu","given":"Lizhen"},{"family":"Schwartz","given":"Roy"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Noah A."},{"family":"Solorio","given":"Thamar"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jingyan"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Xiaodan"},{"family":"Rogers","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Nihar B."},{"family":"Gurevych","given":"Iryna"}],"citation-key":"kuznetsov2024","DOI":"10.48550/ARXIV.2405.06563","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"license":"Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 International","note":"10 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09]\n10 citations (Semantic Scholar/arXiv) [2025-04-02]\n10 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-01]","publisher":"arXiv","source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"What Can Natural Language Processing Do for Peer Review?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06563","version":"1"},
  {"id":"kwa2025","abstract":"Despite rapid progress on AI benchmarks, the real-world meaning of benchmark performance remains unclear. To quantify the capabilities of AI systems in terms of human capabilities, we propose a new metric: 50%-task-completion time horizon. This is the time humans typically take to complete tasks that AI models can complete with 50% success rate. We first timed humans with relevant domain expertise on a combination of RE-Bench, HCAST, and 66 novel shorter tasks. On these tasks, current frontier AI models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet have a 50% time horizon of around 50 minutes. Furthermore, frontier AI time horizon has been doubling approximately every seven months since 2019, though the trend may have accelerated in 2024. The increase in AI models' time horizons seems to be primarily driven by greater reliability and ability to adapt to mistakes, combined with better logical reasoning and tool use capabilities. We discuss the limitations of our results -- including their degree of external validity -- and the implications of increased autonomy for dangerous capabilities. If these results generalize to real-world software tasks, extrapolation of this trend predicts that within 5 years, AI systems will be capable of automating many software tasks that currently take humans a month.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Kwa","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"West","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Becker","given":"Joel"},{"family":"Deng","given":"Amy"},{"family":"Garcia","given":"Katharyn"},{"family":"Hasin","given":"Max"},{"family":"Jawhar","given":"Sami"},{"family":"Kinniment","given":"Megan"},{"family":"Rush","given":"Nate"},{"family":"Arx","given":"Sydney Von"},{"family":"Bloom","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Broadley","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Du","given":"Haoxing"},{"family":"Goodrich","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Jurkovic","given":"Nikola"},{"family":"Miles","given":"Luke Harold"},{"family":"Nix","given":"Seraphina"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Parikh","given":"Neev"},{"family":"Rein","given":"David"},{"family":"Sato","given":"Lucas Jun Koba"},{"family":"Wijk","given":"Hjalmar"},{"family":"Ziegler","given":"Daniel M."},{"family":"Barnes","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Chan","given":"Lawrence"}],"citation-key":"kwa2025","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2503.14499","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,18]]},"number":"arXiv:2503.14499","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Measuring AI Ability to Complete Long Tasks","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14499"},

Aiming to synthesize empirical studies, we employed a qualitative approach to scrutinize AI’s role in supporting SRL processes. Through a meticulous selection process adhering to PRISMA guidelines, we identified 14 distinct studies that leveraged AI applications, including chatbots, adaptive feedback systems, serious games, and e-textbooks, to support student autonomy. Our findings reveal a nuanced landscape where AI demonstrates potential in facilitating SRL’s forethought, performance, and reflection phases, yet also highlights whether the agency is human-centered or AI-centered leading to variations in the SRL model. This review underscores the imperative for balanced AI integration, ensuring technological advantages are harnessed without undermining student self-efficacy. The implications suggest a future where AI is a thoughtfully woven thread in the SRL fabric of higher education, calling for further research to optimize this synergy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",11,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Lan","given":"Min"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Xiaofeng"}],"citation-key":"lan2025","container-title":"npj Science of Learning","container-title-short":"npj Sci.

We survey 319 knowledge workers to investigate 1) when and how they perceive the enaction of critical thinking when using GenAI, and 2) when and why GenAI affects their effort to do so. Participants shared 936 first-hand examples of using GenAI in work tasks. Quantitatively, when considering both task- and user-specific factors, a user’s task-specific self-confidence and confidence in GenAI are predictive of whether critical thinking is enacted and the effort of doing so in GenAI-assisted tasks. Specifically, higher confidence in GenAI is associated with less critical thinking, while higher self-confidence is associated with more critical thinking. Qualitatively, GenAI shifts the nature of critical thinking toward information verification, response integration, and task stewardship.

  {"id":"liu2023","abstract":"Given the rapid ascent of large language models (LLMs), we study the question: (How) can large language models help in reviewing of scientific papers or proposals? We first conduct some pilot studies where we find that (i) GPT-4 outperforms other LLMs (Bard, Vicuna, Koala, Alpaca, LLaMa, Dolly, OpenAssistant, StableLM), and (ii) prompting with a specific question (e.g., to identify errors) outperforms prompting to simply write a review. With these insights, we study the use of LLMs (specifically, GPT-4) for three tasks: 1. Identifying errors: We construct 13 short computer science papers each with a deliberately inserted error, and ask the LLM to check for the correctness of these papers. We observe that the LLM finds errors in 7 of them, spanning both mathematical and conceptual errors. 2. Verifying checklists: We task the LLM to verify 16 closed-ended checklist questions in the respective sections of 15 NeurIPS 2022 papers. We find that across 119 {checklist question, paper} pairs, the LLM had an 86.6% accuracy. 3. Choosing the \"better\" paper: We generate 10 pairs of abstracts, deliberately designing each pair in such a way that one abstract was clearly superior than the other. The LLM, however, struggled to discern these relatively straightforward distinctions accurately, committing errors in its evaluations for 6 out of the 10 pairs. Based on these experiments, we think that LLMs have a promising use as reviewing assistants for specific reviewing tasks, but not (yet) for complete evaluations of papers or proposals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Nihar B."}],"citation-key":"liu2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2306.00622","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,1]]},"note":"58 citations (Semantic Scholar/arXiv) [2025-04-09]\n58 citations (Semantic Scholar/arXiv) [2025-04-02]\n58 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-01]","number":"arXiv:2306.00622","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"ReviewerGPT?

  {"id":"lo2023","abstract":"An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT’s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPT’s performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Lo","given":"Chung Kwan"}],"citation-key":"lo2023","container-title":"Education Sciences","container-title-short":"Education Sciences","DOI":"10.3390/educsci13040410","ISSN":"2227-7102","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,18]]},"language":"en","page":"410","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education?

  {"id":"love2025","abstract":"Conversational teachable agents offer a promising platform to support learning, both in the classroom and in remote settings. In this context, the agent takes the role of the novice, while the student takes on the role of teacher, eliciting the Protégé effect, a pedagogical phenomenon known to increase engagement in the teaching task, and also improve cognitive outcomes. In prior work, interactions with teachable agents show frequent use of interface elements to support learning, and few examples utilise natural language as the sole interaction modality between both user and agent. This work investigates the effect of teaching using natural language while interacting with a virtual agent via the Curiosity Notebook on learning outcomes and engagement. A method of teaching by selecting sentences from source material is compared to paraphrasing from the source material and typing. The results indicate that teaching by paraphrasing in natural language is perceived as being more helpful for learning, but that this perception of improvement is not reflected in actual learning gain over a fixed interaction. Participants also show a short-term preference for teaching via sentence-selection, which they perceive as requiring less effort. There is a positive relationship between the amount of paraphrasing users engage in and improved learning outcomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Love","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Law","given":"Edith"},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Philip R."},{"family":"Kulić","given":"Dana"}],"citation-key":"love2025","container-title":"International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education","container-title-short":"Int J Artif Intell Educ","DOI":"10.1007/s40593-025-00461-1","ISSN":"1560-4306","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,17]]},"language":"en","note":"1 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-22]","source":"Springer Link","title":"Teaching a Conversational Agent using Natural Language: Effect on Learning and Engagement","title-short":"Teaching a Conversational Agent using Natural Language","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40593-025-00461-1"},

  {"id":"lu2024","abstract":"One of the grand challenges of artificial general intelligence is developing agents capable of conducting scientific research and discovering new knowledge. While frontier models have already been used as aides to human scientists, e.g. for brainstorming ideas, writing code, or prediction tasks, they still conduct only a small part of the scientific process. This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for fully automatic scientific discovery, enabling frontier large language models to perform research independently and communicate their findings. We introduce The AI Scientist, which generates novel research ideas, writes code, executes experiments, visualizes results, describes its findings by writing a full scientific paper, and then runs a simulated review process for evaluation. In principle, this process can be repeated to iteratively develop ideas in an open-ended fashion, acting like the human scientific community. We demonstrate its versatility by applying it to three distinct subfields of machine learning: diffusion modeling, transformer-based language modeling, and learning dynamics. Each idea is implemented and developed into a full paper at a cost of less than $15 per paper. To evaluate the generated papers, we design and validate an automated reviewer, which we show achieves near-human performance in evaluating paper scores. The AI Scientist can produce papers that exceed the acceptance threshold at a top machine learning conference as judged by our automated reviewer. This approach signifies the beginning of a new era in scientific discovery in machine learning: bringing the transformative benefits of AI agents to the entire research process of AI itself, and taking us closer to a world where endless affordable creativity and innovation can be unleashed on the world's most challenging problems.

In order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the research landscape, we conduct a systematic literature review on the studies of ChatGPT used in higher education. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were adopted to bibliometrically examine the included literature selected from Web of Science and Scopus through the PRISMA protocol. Tools of VOSviewer and CitNetExplorer were employed to visualize the citation information. Our findings showed that the recent two years witnessed an ever-growing popularity of this research theme. Citation information analysis reveals the most influential authors, countries, sources, organizations and four focused topics. The disciplinary distribution of related research indicates a wide range of categories. More importantly, ChatGPT was found to be versatile in assisting teachers, students and researchers with a variety of tasks, and the factors influencing the acceptance of this technology among college students could be investigated through models like TAM, UTAUT and their extensions. We suggest future studies to focus on the ways to address the limitations and ethical issues of ChatGPT through AI literacy cultivation and joint efforts of all stakeholders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Ma","given":"Ting"}],"citation-key":"ma2025","container-title":"Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence","container-title-short":"Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence","DOI":"10.1016/j.caeai.2024.100336","ISSN":"2666-920X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,1]]},"note":"1 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09]\n1 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-07]","page":"100336","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Systematically visualizing ChatGPT used in higher education: Publication trend, disciplinary domains, research themes, adoption and acceptance","title-short":"Systematically visualizing ChatGPT used in higher education","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X24001395","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"macfarlane","abstract":"This paper develops a typology for understanding forms of critique about teaching in higher education by drawing on a thematic analysis of papers published in a specialist journal between 1996 and 2023. Based on an analysis of more than 1,000 papers, three broad conceptual categories of critique are identified, labelled as functional pragmatism, learning theory, and critical theory. Functional pragmatism is largely data-driven and concerned with critiquing so-called ‘traditional’ teaching methods. Learning theorists self-identify with particular teaching and learning approaches and methods such as social constructivism, experiential learning, reflexivity, action learning, problem-based learning, and the ‘flipped’ classroom to advocate change while critical theorists advance multi-global perspectives pertaining to equity and social justice including climate change and sustainability, epistemic injustice, southern theory, indigenisation and decolonisation, feminism, social and racial justice, and often critique the effects of neo-liberalism. Over time there has been a shifting balance between these three types of critique with critical theory now in the ascendancy and functional pragmatism in decline. This is indicative of a substantial re-balancing between abstract empiricism and grand theory with researchers shifting from considering ‘what works?’ on the basis of observation, testing and measurement to ‘what is wrong and needs to change?’ by reference to more philosophically and sociologically grounded explanatory frameworks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Macfarlane","given":"Bruce"}],"citation-key":"macfarlane","container-title":"Studies in Higher Education","DOI":"10.1080/03075079.2025.2536594","ISSN":"0307-5079","issue":"0","page":"1–12","publisher":"SRHE Website","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"A typology of critique about higher education teaching: functional pragmatists, learning theorists, and critical theorists","title-short":"A typology of critique about higher education teaching","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/03075079.2025.2536594","volume":"0"},
  {"id":"marangunic2015b","abstract":"With the ever-increasing development of technology and its integration into users’ private and professional life, a decision regarding its acceptance or rejection still remains an open question. A respectable amount of work dealing with the technology acceptance model (TAM), from its first appearance more than a quarter of a century ago, clearly indicates a popularity of the model in the field of technology acceptance. Originated in the psychological theory of reasoned action and theory of planned behavior, TAM has evolved to become a key model in understanding predictors of human behavior toward potential acceptance or rejection of the technology. The main aim of the paper is to provide an up-to-date, well-researched resource of past and current references to TAM-related literature and to identify possible directions for future TAM research. The paper presents a comprehensive concept-centric literature review of the TAM, from 1986 onwards. According to a designed methodology, 85 scientific publications have been selected and classified according to their aim and content into three categories such as (i) TAM literature reviews, (ii) development and extension of TAM, and (iii) modification and application of TAM. Despite a continuous progress in revealing new factors with significant influence on TAM’s core variables, there are still many unexplored areas of model potential application that could contribute to its predictive validity. Consequently, four possible future directions for TAM research based on the conducted literature review and analysis are identified and presented.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Marangunić","given":"Nikola"},{"family":"Granić","given":"Andrina"}],"citation-key":"marangunic2015b","container-title":"Universal Access in the Information Society","container-title-short":"Univ Access Inf Soc","DOI":"10.1007/s10209-014-0348-1","ISSN":"1615-5297","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",3,1]]},"language":"en","note":"1577 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09]","page":"81–95","source":"Springer Link","title":"Technology acceptance model: a literature review from 1986 to 2013","title-short":"Technology acceptance model","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10209-014-0348-1","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"meincke2025","abstract":"This is the first of a series of short reports that seek to help business, education, and policy leaders understand the technical details of working with AI through rigorous testing. In this report, we demonstrate two things: - There is no single standard for measuring whether a Large Language Model (LLM) passes a benchmark, and that choosing a standard has a big impact on how well the LLM does on that benchmark. The standard you choose will depend on your goals for using an LLM in a particular case. - It is hard to know in advance whether a particular prompting approach will help or harm the LLM's ability to answer any particular question. Specifically, we find that sometimes being polite to the LLM helps performance, and sometimes it lowers performance. We also find that constraining the AI's answers helps performance in some cases, though it may lower performance in other cases. Taken together, this suggests that benchmarking AI performance is not one-size-fits-all, and also that particular prompting formulas or approaches, like being polite to the AI, are not universally valuable.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Meincke","given":"Lennart"},{"family":"Mollick","given":"Ethan"},{"family":"Mollick","given":"Lilach"},{"family":"Shapiro","given":"Dan"}],"citation-key":"meincke2025","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2503.04818","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,4]]},"note":"0 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-24]","number":"arXiv:2503.04818","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Prompting Science Report 1: Prompt Engineering is Complicated and Contingent","title-short":"Prompting Science Report 1","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04818"},
  {"id":"meincke2025a","abstract":"This is the second in a series of short reports that seek to help business, education, and policy leaders understand the technical details of working with AI through rigorous testing. In this report, we investigate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, a technique that encourages a large language model (LLM) to \"think step by step\" (Wei et al., 2022). CoT is a widely adopted method for improving reasoning tasks, however, our findings reveal a more nuanced picture of its effectiveness. We demonstrate two things: - The effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought prompting can vary greatly depending on the type of task and model. For non-reasoning models, CoT generally improves average performance by a small amount, particularly if the model does not inherently engage in step-by-step processing by default. However, CoT can introduce more variability in answers, sometimes triggering occasional errors in questions the model would otherwise get right. We also found that many recent models perform some form of CoT reasoning even if not asked; for these models, a request to perform CoT had little impact. Performing CoT generally requires far more tokens (increasing cost and time) than direct answers. - For models designed with explicit reasoning capabilities, CoT prompting often results in only marginal, if any, gains in answer accuracy. However, it significantly increases the time and tokens needed to generate a response.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Meincke","given":"Lennart"},{"family":"Mollick","given":"Ethan R."},{"family":"Mollick","given":"Lilach"},{"family":"Shapiro","given":"Dan"}],"citation-key":"meincke2025a","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2506.07142","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,8]]},"note":"2 citations (Semantic Scholar/arXiv) [2025-08-26]","number":"arXiv:2506.07142","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Prompting Science Report 2: The Decreasing Value of Chain of Thought in Prompting","title-short":"Prompting Science Report 2","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07142"},

In this report, we investigate two commonly held prompting beliefs: a) offering to tip the AI model and b) threatening the AI model. Tipping was a commonly shared tactic for improving AI performance and threats have been endorsed by Google Founder Sergey Brin (All-In, May 2025, 8:20) who observed that 'models tend to do better if you threaten them,' a claim we subject to empirical testing here. We evaluate model performance on GPQA (Rein et al. 2024) and MMLU-Pro (Wang et al. 2024). We demonstrate two things: - Threatening or tipping a model generally has no significant effect on benchmark performance. - Prompt variations can significantly affect performance on a per-question level. However, it is hard to know in advance whether a particular prompting approach will help or harm the LLM's ability to answer any particular question. Taken together, this suggests that simple prompting variations might not be as effective as previously assumed, especially for difficult problems. However, as reported previously (Meincke et al. 2025a), prompting approaches can yield significantly different results for individual questions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Meincke","given":"Lennart"},{"family":"Mollick","given":"Ethan"},{"family":"Mollick","given":"Lilach"},{"family":"Shapiro","given":"Dan"}],"citation-key":"meincke2025b","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2508.00614","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",8,1]]},"number":"arXiv:2508.00614","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Prompting Science Report 3: I'll pay you or I'll kill you -- but will you care?","title-short":"Prompting Science Report 3","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00614"},

Additionally,  learners found it to be time-efficient and easy to access information. Concerns were raised regarding its limitations and risks such as the hindrance to critical thinking and independent research skills, difficulties in engaging with longer texts for deeper comprehension, and the possibility of writing style homogenization and loss of uniqueness among others. The results highlighted several essential strategies adopted by learners to optimize ChatGPT usage as a learning tool. In addition, most users demonstrated a preference for spending much time using ChatGPT compared to other digital information tools, signalling a paradigm shift toward increased utilization of generative AI in learning.

  {"id":"murray2021","abstract":"Organizations are increasingly deploying technologies that have the ability to parse through large amounts of data, acquire skills and knowledge, and operate autonomously. These technologies diverge from prior technologies in their capacity to exercise intentionality over protocol development or action selection in the practice of organizational routines, thereby affecting organizations in new and distinct ways. In this article, we categorize four forms of conjoined agency between humans and technologies: (1) conjoined agency with assisting technologies, (2) conjoined agency with arresting technologies, (3) conjoined agency with augmenting technologies, and (4) conjoined agency with automating technologies. We then theorize on the different ways in which these forms of conjoined agency impact a routine’s change at a particular moment in time as well as a routine’s responsiveness to feedback over time. In doing so, we elaborate on how organizations may evolve in varied and diverse ways based on the form(s) of conjoined agency they deploy in their organizational design choices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",12,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Murray","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Rhymer","given":"Jen"},{"family":"Sirmon","given":"David G."}],"citation-key":"murray2021","container-title":"Academy of Management Review","container-title-short":"AMR","DOI":"10.5465/amr.2019.0186","ISSN":"0363-7425","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7]]},"page":"552–571","publisher":"Academy of Management","source":"journals.aom.org (Atypon)","title":"Humans and Technology: Forms of Conjoined Agency in Organizations","title-short":"Humans and Technology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.aom.org/doi/full/10.5465/amr.2019.0186","volume":"46"},

Indeed, some educators would argue this is part of a larger paradigm shift in the latter part of last century towards student-centred learning. Conscious of this paradigm shift and the ever-present competing assessment discourses, the review investigates the growing interest in student partnership in assessment specifically, distinct from wider arenas of student partnership. This literature scoping review aims to demystify the ways in which those who teach can partner students by exploring initiatives such as involving them as self or peer assessors, as co-creators of assessment activities and marking criteria, and the use of collaborative opportunities to co-own the assessment process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Ní Bheoláin","given":"Ruth"},{"family":"Lowney","given":"Rob"},{"family":"O'Riordan","given":"Fiona"}],"citation-key":"nibheolain2020","DOI":"10.5281/zenodo.4270579","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,15]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Zenodo","source":"Zenodo","title":"Students as Partners in Assessment (SaPiA): A Literature Scoping Review","title-short":"Students as Partners in Assessment (SaPiA)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://zenodo.org/records/4270579"},
  {"id":"nickow2020","abstract":"Tutoring—defined here as one-on-one or small-group instructional programming by teachers, paraprofessionals, volunteers, or parents—is one of the most versatile and potentially transformative educational tools in use today. Within the past decade, dozens of preK-12 tutoring experiments have been conducted, varying widely in their approach, context, and cost. Our study represents the first systematic review and meta-analysis of these and earlier studies. We develop a framework for considering different types of programs to not only examine overall effects, but also explore how these effects vary by program characteristics and intervention context. We find that tutoring programs yield consistent and substantial positive impacts on learning outcomes, with an overall pooled effect size estimate of 0.37 SD. Effects are stronger, on average, for teacher and paraprofessional tutoring programs than for nonprofessional and parent tutoring. Effects also tend to be strongest among the earlier grades. While overall effects for reading and math interventions are similar, reading tutoring tends to yield higher effect sizes in earlier grades, while math tutoring tends to yield higher effect sizes in later grades. Tutoring programs conducted during school tend to have larger impacts than those conducted after school.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Nickow","given":"Andre"},{"family":"Oreopoulos","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Quan","given":"Vincent"}],"citation-key":"nickow2020","collection-title":"Working Paper Series","DOI":"10.3386/w27476","genre":"Working Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7]]},"note":"128 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09]\n127 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-01]","number":"27476","publisher":"National Bureau of Economic Research","source":"National Bureau of Economic Research","title":"The Impressive Effects of Tutoring on PreK-12 Learning: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Experimental Evidence","title-short":"The Impressive Effects of Tutoring on PreK-12 Learning","type":"article","URL":"https://www.nber.org/papers/w27476"},

  {"id":"nori2023","abstract":"Generalist foundation models such as GPT-4 have displayed surprising capabilities in a wide variety of domains and tasks. Yet, there is a prevalent assumption that they cannot match specialist capabilities of fine-tuned models. For example, most explorations to date on medical competency benchmarks have leveraged domain-specific training, as exemplified by efforts on BioGPT and Med-PaLM. We build on a prior study of GPT-4's capabilities on medical challenge benchmarks in the absence of special training. Rather than using simple prompting to highlight the model's out-of-the-box capabilities, we perform a systematic exploration of prompt engineering. We find that prompting innovation can unlock deeper specialist capabilities and show that GPT-4 easily tops prior leading results for medical benchmarks. The prompting methods we explore are general purpose, and make no specific use of domain expertise, removing the need for expert-curated content. Our experimental design carefully controls for overfitting during the prompt engineering process. We introduce Medprompt, based on a composition of several prompting strategies. With Medprompt, GPT-4 achieves state-of-the-art results on all nine of the benchmark datasets in the MultiMedQA suite. The method outperforms leading specialist models such as Med-PaLM 2 by a significant margin with an order of magnitude fewer calls to the model. Steering GPT-4 with Medprompt achieves a 27% reduction in error rate on the MedQA dataset over the best methods to date achieved with specialist models and surpasses a score of 90% for the first time. Beyond medical problems, we show the power of Medprompt to generalize to other domains and provide evidence for the broad applicability of the approach via studies of the strategy on exams in electrical engineering, machine learning, philosophy, accounting, law, nursing, and clinical psychology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Nori","given":"Harsha"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Yin Tat"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Sheng"},{"family":"Carignan","given":"Dean"},{"family":"Edgar","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Fusi","given":"Nicolo"},{"family":"King","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Larson","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yuanzhi"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Weishung"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Renqian"},{"family":"McKinney","given":"Scott Mayer"},{"family":"Ness","given":"Robert Osazuwa"},{"family":"Poon","given":"Hoifung"},{"family":"Qin","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Usuyama","given":"Naoto"},{"family":"White","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Horvitz","given":"Eric"}],"citation-key":"nori2023","DOI":"10.48550/ARXIV.2311.16452","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International","note":"270 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09]\n265 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-02]\n265 citations (Semantic Scholar/arXiv) [2025-04-01]","publisher":"arXiv","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Can Generalist Foundation Models Outcompete Special-Purpose Tuning?

  {"id":"ogunleye2024","abstract":"The use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in academia is a subjective and hotly debated topic. Currently, there are no agreed guidelines towards the usage of GenAI systems in higher education (HE) and, thus, it is still unclear how to make effective use of the technology for teaching and learning practice. This paper provides an overview of the current state of research on GenAI for teaching and learning in HE. To this end, this study conducted a systematic review of relevant studies indexed by Scopus, using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The search criteria revealed a total of 625 research papers, of which 355 met the final inclusion criteria. The findings from the review showed the current state and the future trends in documents, citations, document sources/authors, keywords, and co-authorship. The research gaps identified suggest that while some authors have looked at understanding the detection of AI-generated text, it may be beneficial to understand how GenAI can be incorporated into supporting the educational curriculum for assessments, teaching, and learning delivery. Furthermore, there is a need for additional interdisciplinary, multidimensional studies in HE through collaboration. This will strengthen the awareness and understanding of students, tutors, and other stakeholders, which will be instrumental in formulating guidelines, frameworks, and policies for GenAI usage.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Ogunleye","given":"Bayode"},{"family":"Zakariyyah","given":"Kudirat Ibilola"},{"family":"Ajao","given":"Oluwaseun"},{"family":"Olayinka","given":"Olakunle"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Hemlata"}],"citation-key":"ogunleye2024","container-title":"Education Sciences","DOI":"10.3390/educsci14060636","ISSN":"2227-7102","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",6]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","note":"21 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-01]","number":"6","page":"636","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"A Systematic Review of Generative AI for Teaching and Learning Practice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7102/14/6/636","volume":"14"},

It's trained end-to-end across text, vision, and audio, meaning all inputs and outputs are processed by the same neural network. GPT-4o can respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, with an average of 320 milliseconds, which is similar to human response time in conversation. It matches GPT-4 Turbo performance on text in English and code, with significant improvement on text in non-English languages, while also being much faster and 50\\% cheaper in the API. GPT-4o is especially better at vision and audio understanding compared to existing models. In line with our commitment to building AI safely and consistent with our voluntary commitments to the White House, we are sharing the GPT-4o System Card, which includes our Preparedness Framework evaluations. In this System Card, we provide a detailed look at GPT-4o's capabilities, limitations, and safety evaluations across multiple categories, focusing on speech-to-speech while also evaluating text and image capabilities, and measures we've implemented to ensure the model is safe and aligned.

  {"id":"ou2024","abstract":"AI-powered language tools (AILTs) are commonly used by university students, yet there is a limited understanding of how students utilise and perceive these tools in everyday academic communication practice. Employing a post-humanist lens and based on over 1700 open-ended comments from a nationwide student survey, this qualitative study examined students' lived AILT experiences to explicate the impact of AILTs on academic communication in higher education learning and assessment. Thematic analysis of the data shows that students' academic writing is realised by assemblages of distributed spatial and personal linguistic repertoires, underscoring AILT's role in enhancing students' communicative performance and personal language development. AILTs are also conducive to transforming the academic writing process into an additional learning space. Students have developed a new identity as spatially advised learners, enabling them to assert their agency in terms of language development and subject-content knowledge while also holding critical perspectives on the limitations of AI. Furthermore, the findings point to divergent and eclectic student viewpoints on the ethical concerns of AILTs in assessment in the absence of university instructions. The study discusses implications for university policymaking and pedagogy in developing teaching and assessment methods that match students' stances and needs in AI-mediated academic communication.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Ou","given":"Amy Wanyu"},{"family":"Stöhr","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Malmström","given":"Hans"}],"citation-key":"ou2024","container-title":"System","container-title-short":"System","DOI":"10.1016/j.system.2024.103225","ISSN":"0346-251X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,1]]},"note":"39 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09]\n39 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-07]","page":"103225","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Academic communication with AI-powered language tools in higher education: From a post-humanist perspective","title-short":"Academic communication with AI-powered language tools in higher education","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0346251X24000071","volume":"121"},

  {"id":"perrenet2000","abstract":"This article describes the characteristics and aims of problem-based learning (PBL), a successful strategy for higher education. PBL has been implemented as an overall strategy for several programmes at Maastricht University, for example medicine. The suitability of PBL as an innovation in engineering education is analysed, given the characteristics of this particular domain. Project work and guided small group work also present themselves as alternatives for conventional engineering education. PBL has been implemented as a partial strategy for Mechanical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering at Technische Universiteit Eindhoven. The differences between the medical and the engineering implementation are analysed. PBL offers good prospects in the first few years of a programme, especially if group work tutorials and some directive teaching are added. In later phases project work offers a strong alternative. The conclusion is that PBL has certain limitations, which make it less suitable as an overall strategy for engineering education.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Perrenet","given":"J.

  {"id":"rahman2023","abstract":"In recent years, the rise of advanced artificial intelligence technologies has had a profound impact on many fields, including education and research. One such technology is ChatGPT, a powerful large language model developed by OpenAI. This technology offers exciting opportunities for students and educators, including personalized feedback, increased accessibility, interactive conversations, lesson preparation, evaluation, and new ways to teach complex concepts. However, ChatGPT poses different threats to the traditional education and research system, including the possibility of cheating on online exams, human-like text generation, diminished critical thinking skills, and difficulties in evaluating information generated by ChatGPT. This study explores the potential opportunities and threats that ChatGPT poses to overall education from the perspective of students and educators. Furthermore, for programming learning, we explore how ChatGPT helps students improve their programming skills. To demonstrate this, we conducted different coding-related experiments with ChatGPT, including code generation from problem descriptions, pseudocode generation of algorithms from texts, and code correction. The generated codes are validated with an online judge system to evaluate their accuracy. In addition, we conducted several surveys with students and teachers to find out how ChatGPT supports programming learning and teaching.

While routine tasks can be automated, the intricate nature of exploratory tasks, such as\nsolving new problems, demands a hybrid approach that integrates human intelligence with AI. We argue that the outcomes of this human-AI collaboration are contingent on the processes employed\nto combine human and artificial intelligence. Our model unpacks three hybrid problem-solving processes and their outcomes: Compared to human problem solving, autonomous search generates\nmore distant solutions, sequential search enables more local solutions, and interactive search promotes more recombinative ones. Collectively, these hybrid problem-solving processes broaden\nthe range of organizational search outcomes. We enrich the behavioral theory of the firm with a technology-conscious perspective of organizational problem solving that complements its\ntraditional human-centric perspective. Additionally, we contribute to the literature on AI in management by extending its scope from using predictive AI for routine tasks to generative AI applications for more exploratory tasks, such as search and problem solving.","author":[{"family":"Raisch","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Fomina","given":"Kateryna"}],"citation-key":"raisch2024","container-title":"Academy of Management Review","container-title-short":"Academy of Management Review","DOI":"10.5465/amr.2021.0421","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,5]]},"note":"101 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-12-23]","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Combining Human and Artificial Intelligence: Hybrid Problem-Solving in Organizations","title-short":"Combining Human and Artificial Intelligence","type":"article-journal","volume":"50"},

We studied this effect with educationally relevant materials and investigated whether testing facilitates learning only because tests offer an opportunity to restudy material. In two experiments, students studied prose passages and took one or three immediate free-recall tests, without feedback, or restudied the material the same number of times as the students who received tests. Students then took a final retention test 5 min, 2 days, or 1 week later. When the final test was given after 5 min, repeated studying improved recall relative to repeated testing. However, on the delayed tests, prior testing produced substantially greater retention than studying, even though repeated studying increased students' confidence in their ability to remember the material.

  {"id":"roediger2012","abstract":"The need to improve the educational system has never been greater. People in congress and business argue for expensive technological applications to improve education despite a lack of empirical evidence for their efficacy. We argue that one inexpensive avenue for improving education has been largely ignored. Cognitive and educational psychologists have identified strategies that greatly improve learning and retention of information, and yet these techniques are not generally applied in education nor taught in education schools. In fact, teachers often use instructional practices known to be wrong (i.e., massing rather than interleaving examples to explain a topic). We identify three general principles that are inexpensive to implement and have been shown in both laboratory and field experiments to improve learning: (1) distribution (spacing and interleaving) of practice in learning facts and skills; (2) retrieval practice (via self testing) for durable learning; and (3) explanatory questioning (elaborative interrogation and self-explanation) as a study strategy. We describe each technique, provide supporting evidence, and discuss classroom applications. Each principle can be applied to most subject matters from kindergarten to higher education. Applying findings from cognitive psychology to classroom instruction is no panacea for educational problems, but it represents one helpful and inexpensive strategy.","author":[{"family":"Roediger","given":"Henry L."},{"family":"Pyc","given":"Mary A."}],"citation-key":"roediger2012","container-title":"Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.jarmac.2012.09.002","ISSN":"22113681","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"page":"242–248","title":"Inexpensive techniques to improve education: Applying cognitive psychology to enhance educational practice","type":"article-journal","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"rudolph2023","abstract":"ChatGPT is the world’s most advanced chatbot thus far. Unlike other chatbots, it can create impressive prose within seconds, and it has created much hype and doomsday predictions when it comes to student assessment in higher education and a host of other matters. ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art language model (a variant of OpenAI’s Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) language model) designed to generate text that can be indistinguishable from text written by humans. It can engage in conversation with users in a seemingly natural and intuitive way.\nIn this article, we briefly tell the story of OpenAI, the organisation behind ChatGPT. We highlight the fundamental change from a not-for-profit organisation to a commercial business model. In terms of our methods, we conducted an extensive literature review and experimented with this artificial intelligence (AI) software. Our literature review shows our review to be amongst the first peer-reviewed academic journal articles to explore ChatGPT and its relevance for higher education (especially assessment, learning and teaching). After a description of ChatGPT’s functionality and a summary of its strengths and limitations, we focus on the technology’s implications for higher education and discuss what is the future of learning, teaching and assessment in higher education in the context of AI chatbots such as ChatGPT. We position ChatGPT in the context of current Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) research, discuss student-facing, teacher-facing and system-facing applications, and analyse opportunities and threats. We conclude the article with recommendations for students, teachers and higher education institutions. Many of them focus on assessment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Rudolph","given":"Jürgen"},{"family":"Tan","given":"Samson"},{"family":"Tan","given":"Shannon"}],"citation-key":"rudolph2023","container-title":"Journal of Applied Learning and Teaching","DOI":"10.37074/jalt.2023.6.1.9","ISSN":"2591-801X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,24]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2023 Journal of Applied Learning and Teaching","number":"1","page":"342–363","source":"journals.sfu.ca","title":"ChatGPT: Bullshit spewer or the end of traditional assessments in higher education?","title-short":"ChatGPT","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.sfu.ca/jalt/index.php/jalt/article/view/689","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"saif2024","abstract":"The current study aims to establish a connection between students' behavioral concerns, namely stress and anxiety, related to the completion of academic tasks, and their integration of technology using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) through the utilization of Chat-GPT via ubiquitous learning (UL) procedure. To achieve this objective, data was collected from 156 students studying management science who were engaged in their final year research projects or internship reports from selected universities in Pakistan. The gathered data underwent analysis through Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using Smart PLS software. The findings reveal a significant relationship: students' stress contributes to the emergence of anxiety, which in turn motivates the adoption of technology-assisted solutions, specifically Chat-GPT, to efficiently complete assigned tasks within deadlines working through any device from anywhere. Consequently, the perceived ease of use and usefulness associated with Chat-GPT's AI-generated text contribute to shaping students' favorable attitudes toward utilizing Chat-GPT and also play a role in reducing their stress levels. Furthermore, the study confirms that the development of a positive attitude in students acts as a driving force, compelling them to engage with Chat-GPT through ubiquitous learning (UL) procedure, ultimately resulting in increased actual usage of Chat-GPT. This pattern, in turn, contributes to stress and anxiety reduction among management science students. The study's outcomes corroborate the TAM model, which aligns with the social exchange process, demonstrating its applicability within the context of the educational setup in management sciences and its potential to enhance the learning experiences of researchers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Saif","given":"Naveed"},{"family":"Khan","given":"Sajid Ullah"},{"family":"Shaheen","given":"Imrab"},{"family":"ALotaibi","given":"Faiz Abdullah"},{"family":"Alnfiai","given":"Mrim M."},{"family":"Arif","given":"Mohammad"}],"citation-key":"saif2024","container-title":"Computers in Human Behavior","container-title-short":"Computers in Human Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/j.chb.2023.108097","ISSN":"0747-5632","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,1]]},"note":"100 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09]\n100 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09]","page":"108097","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Chat-GPT; validating Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in education sector via ubiquitous learning mechanism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074756322300448X","volume":"154"},

Med-PaLM 2 scores up to 86.5% on the MedQA dataset, improving upon Med-PaLM by over 19%, and demonstrates dramatic performance increases across MedMCQA, PubMedQA and MMLU clinical topics datasets. Our detailed human evaluations framework shows that physicians prefer Med-PaLM 2 answers to those from other physicians on eight of nine clinical axes. Med-PaLM 2 also demonstrates significant improvements over its predecessor across all evaluation metrics, particularly on new adversarial datasets designed to probe LLM limitations (P < 0.001). In a pilot study using real-world medical questions, specialists preferred Med-PaLM 2 answers to generalist physician answers 65% of the time. While specialist answers were still preferred overall, both specialists and generalists rated Med-PaLM 2 to be as safe as physician answers, demonstrating its growing potential in real-world medical applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Singhal","given":"Karan"},{"family":"Tu","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Gottweis","given":"Juraj"},{"family":"Sayres","given":"Rory"},{"family":"Wulczyn","given":"Ellery"},{"family":"Amin","given":"Mohamed"},{"family":"Hou","given":"Le"},{"family":"Clark","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Pfohl","given":"Stephen R."},{"family":"Cole-Lewis","given":"Heather"},{"family":"Neal","given":"Darlene"},{"family":"Rashid","given":"Qazi Mamunur"},{"family":"Schaekermann","given":"Mike"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Amy"},{"family":"Dash","given":"Dev"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Jonathan H."},{"family":"Shah","given":"Nigam H."},{"family":"Lachgar","given":"Sami"},{"family":"Mansfield","given":"Philip Andrew"},{"family":"Prakash","given":"Sushant"},{"family":"Green","given":"Bradley"},{"family":"Dominowska","given":"Ewa"},{"family":"Agüera y Arcas","given":"Blaise"},{"family":"Tomašev","given":"Nenad"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yun"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Renee"},{"family":"Semturs","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Mahdavi","given":"S.

  {"id":"sivarajkumar2023","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially in domains where labeled data is scarce or expensive, such as clinical domain. However, to unlock the clinical knowledge hidden in these LLMs, we need to design effective prompts that can guide them to perform specific clinical NLP tasks without any task-specific training data. This is known as in-context learning, which is an art and science that requires understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different LLMs and prompt engineering approaches. In this paper, we present a comprehensive and systematic experimental study on prompt engineering for five clinical NLP tasks: Clinical Sense Disambiguation, Biomedical Evidence Extraction, Coreference Resolution, Medication Status Extraction, and Medication Attribute Extraction. We assessed the prompts proposed in recent literature, including simple prefix, simple cloze, chain of thought, and anticipatory prompts, and introduced two new types of prompts, namely heuristic prompting and ensemble prompting. We evaluated the performance of these prompts on three state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-3.5, BARD, and LLAMA2. We also contrasted zero-shot prompting with few-shot prompting, and provide novel insights and guidelines for prompt engineering for LLMs in clinical NLP. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first works on the empirical evaluation of different prompt engineering approaches for clinical NLP in this era of generative AI, and we hope that it will inspire and inform future research in this area.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Sivarajkumar","given":"Sonish"},{"family":"Kelley","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Samolyk-Mazzanti","given":"Alyssa"},{"family":"Visweswaran","given":"Shyam"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yanshan"}],"citation-key":"sivarajkumar2023","DOI":"10.48550/ARXIV.2309.08008","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"license":"arXiv.org perpetual, non-exclusive license","note":"24 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09]\n24 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-02]","publisher":"arXiv","source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"An Empirical Evaluation of Prompting Strategies for Large Language Models in Zero-Shot Clinical Natural Language Processing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08008","version":"1"},

Agents must replicate 20 ICML 2024 Spotlight and Oral papers from scratch, including understanding paper contributions, developing a codebase, and successfully executing experiments. For objective evaluation, we develop rubrics that hierarchically decompose each replication task into smaller sub-tasks with clear grading criteria. In total, PaperBench contains 8,316 individually gradable tasks. Rubrics are co-developed with the author(s) of each ICML paper for accuracy and realism. To enable scalable evaluation, we also develop an LLM-based judge to automatically grade replication attempts against rubrics, and assess our judge's performance by creating a separate benchmark for judges. We evaluate several frontier models on PaperBench, finding that the best-performing tested agent, Claude 3.5 Sonnet (New) with open-source scaffolding, achieves an average replication score of 21.0%. Finally, we recruit top ML PhDs to attempt a subset of PaperBench, finding that models do not yet outperform the human baseline.

In this article we report the first comprehensive meta-analysis of its effects on student performance, relative to traditional teaching models, across disciplines and education level. We included 198 studies comprising 33,678 students in our meta-analysis. There were 174 studies conducted at the tertiary level, 21 at secondary, and three at primary school level. Overall, the flipped classroom had a moderate positive effect (g = .50) on student performance. The flipped classroom was beneficial regardless of discipline, with effect sizes ranging from weak (i.e., for IT, g = 0.30; k = 14) to strong (i.e., for humanities, g = 0.98; k = 34). Testing of other moderators relating to group sizes, in-class activities, pre-class testing, and the sophistication of a flipped classroom design provide evidence to suggest that the primary contributing factor to the flipped classroom effect is the opportunity it provides for structured, active learning and problem-solving.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Strelan","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Osborn","given":"Amanda"},{"family":"Palmer","given":"Edward"}],"citation-key":"strelan2020","container-title":"Educational Research Review","container-title-short":"Educational Research Review","DOI":"10.1016/j.edurev.2020.100314","ISSN":"1747-938X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,1]]},"note":"313 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-16]","page":"100314","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The flipped classroom: A meta-analysis of effects on student performance across disciplines and education levels","title-short":"The flipped classroom","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1747938X19301599","volume":"30"},

Instead of deciphering a static response, oral assessments provide instructors the opportunity to probe student explanations, obtaining a more complete picture of their understanding.

Additionally, oral exams allow for flexibility in how students can explain their thinking, potentially helping build students’ identities as statistical thinkers and speakers.

  {"id":"tutton2025","abstract":"This paper reconceptualizes the role of the teacher in the university foreign language classroom in an age of generative AI chatbots and automatic translation tools. We call for a reconceptualization of this role based on two factors: the unique social interactivity of the university language classroom and the need for effective instruction on how to use Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning (ICALL) tools outside of the classroom. We argue that the teacher must master and integrate these two different modes of teaching and learning. Interpersonal exchanges in class respond to the need for real-time human interaction and relatedness in language learning and so cannot, and should not, be wholly replaced by chatbots. Rather, these sorts of exchanges must form a cornerstone of on-campus foreign language pedagogy. In contrast, teachers must also be able to leverage the benefits of learner-facing AI tools, especially for use outside of the classroom, given the learning gains associated with them. We provide detailed examples of how this dual approach can be realized and propose a five-step approach for incorporating AI into university language pedagogy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Tutton","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Doron"}],"citation-key":"tutton2025","container-title":"Education Sciences","DOI":"10.3390/educsci15010056","ISSN":"2227-7102","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"1","page":"56","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Reconceptualizing the Role of the University Language Teacher in Light of Generative AI","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7102/15/1/56","volume":"15"},

The computer tutoring systems were divided by their granularity of the user interface interaction into answer-based, step-based, and substep-based tutoring systems. Most intelligent tutoring systems have step-based or substep-based granularities of interaction, whereas most other tutoring systems (often called CAI, CBT, or CAL systems) have answer-based user interfaces. It is widely believed as the granularity of tutoring decreases, the effectiveness increases. In particular, when compared to No tutoring, the effect sizes of answer-based tutoring systems, intelligent tutoring systems, and adult human tutors are believed to be d = 0.3, 1.0, and 2.0 respectively. This review did not confirm these beliefs. Instead, it found that the effect size of human tutoring was much lower: d = 0.79. Moreover, the effect size of intelligent tutoring systems was 0.76, so they are nearly as effective as human tutoring.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,21]]},"author":[{"family":"VanLEHN","given":"KURT"}],"citation-key":"vanlehn2011","container-title":"Educational Psychologist","DOI":"10.1080/00461520.2011.611369","ISSN":"0046-1520","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",10,1]]},"page":"197–221","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The Relative Effectiveness of Human Tutoring, Intelligent Tutoring Systems, and Other Tutoring Systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00461520.2011.611369","volume":"46"},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

  {"id":"wang2025","abstract":"Intelligent tutoring systems serve as tools capable of providing personalized learning experiences, with their efficacy significantly contingent upon the performance of recommendation models. For long-term instructional plans, these systems necessitate the provision of highly accurate, enduring recommendations. However, numerous existing recommendation models adopt a static perspective, disregarding the sequential decision-making nature of recommendations, rendering them often incapable of adapting to novel contexts. While some recent studies have delved into sequential recommendations, their emphasis predominantly centers on short-term predictions, neglecting the objectives of long-term recommendations. To surmount these challenges, this paper introduces a novel recommendation approach based on deep reinforcement learning. We conceptualize the recommendation process as a Markov Decision Process, employing recurrent neural networks to simulate the interaction between the recommender system and the students. Test results demonstrate that our model not only significantly surpasses traditional Top-N methods in hit rate and NDCG concerning the enhancement of long-term recommendations but also adeptly addresses scenarios involving cold starts. Thus, this model presents a new avenue for enhancing the performance of intelligent tutoring systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Wei"}],"citation-key":"wang2025","container-title":"International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications (IJACSA)","DOI":"10.14569/IJACSA.2025.0160237","ISSN":"2156-5570","issue":"2","issued":{"literal":"2025/26/28"},"language":"en","number":"2","publisher":"The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited","source":"thesai.org","title":"Long-Term Recommendation Model for Online Education Systems: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach","title-short":"Long-Term Recommendation Model for Online Education Systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://thesai.org/Publications/ViewPaper?Volume=16&Issue=2&Code=IJACSA&SerialNo=37","volume":"16"},

In order to foster advances in responsible innovation, an in-depth understanding of the potential risks posed by these models is needed. A wide range of established and anticipated risks are analysed in detail, drawing on multidisciplinary expertise and literature from computer science, linguistics, and social sciences. We outline six specific risk areas: I. Discrimination, Exclusion and Toxicity, II. Information Hazards, III. Misinformation Harms, V. Malicious Uses, V. Human-Computer Interaction Harms, VI. Automation, Access, and Environmental Harms. The first area concerns the perpetuation of stereotypes, unfair discrimination, exclusionary norms, toxic language, and lower performance by social group for LMs. The second focuses on risks from private data leaks or LMs correctly inferring sensitive information. The third addresses risks arising from poor, false or misleading information including in sensitive domains, and knock-on risks such as the erosion of trust in shared information. The fourth considers risks from actors who try to use LMs to cause harm. The fifth focuses on risks specific to LLMs used to underpin conversational agents that interact with human users, including unsafe use, manipulation or deception. The sixth discusses the risk of environmental harm, job automation, and other challenges that may have a disparate effect on different social groups or communities. In total, we review 21 risks in-depth. We discuss the points of origin of different risks and point to potential mitigation approaches. Lastly, we discuss organisational responsibilities in implementing mitigations, and the role of collaboration and participation.

In contrast, comparative judgement appears to overcome the reliability issues that beset the assessment of performance assessment tasks. The approach presented here extends previous work on comparative judgement by directly involving teachers in a large number of schools in the judging of young pupils’ writing. To ensure quality control the process incorporated a process of ‘anchoring’ that ensured that teachers could not artificially inflate their own pupils’ scores. The approach was used to assess the writing of 55,599 primary pupils in England in 2017–2018. Overall, the results showed that a comparative judgement approach to writing incorporating anchoring shows promise in providing a fair and robust large-scale method to assess writing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Wheadon","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"","given":"Barmby ,Patrick"},{"family":"","given":"Christodoulou ,Daisy"},{"family":"Henderson","given":"Brian","non-dropping-particle":"and"}],"citation-key":"wheadon2020","container-title":"Assessment in Education: Principles, Policy & Practice","DOI":"10.1080/0969594X.2019.1700212","ISSN":"0969-594X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,2]]},"note":"24 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-09]","page":"46–64","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"A comparative judgement approach to the large-scale assessment of primary writing in England","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/0969594X.2019.1700212","volume":"27"},

This paper describes a catalog of prompt engineering techniques presented in pattern form that have been applied to solve common problems when conversing with LLMs. Prompt patterns are a knowledge transfer method analogous to software patterns since they provide reusable solutions to common problems faced in a particular context, i.e., output generation and interaction when working with LLMs. This paper provides the following contributions to research on prompt engineering that apply LLMs to automate software development tasks. First, it provides a framework for documenting patterns for structuring prompts to solve a range of problems so that they can be adapted to different domains. Second, it presents a catalog of patterns that have been applied successfully to improve the outputs of LLM conversations.

Employing a quasi-experimental design, the study included 39 junior exchange students, with 18 in the experimental group and 21 in the control group. The approach employed a wiki-based collaborative writing strategy, integrating ChatGPT for written corrective feedback. The 10-week intervention encompassed three writing tasks, involving collaborative outlining, individual writing with AI feedback, and collaborative writing. Statistical analyses, comprising the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Friedman test, revealed substantial improvements in posttest scores for the experimental group in comparison to the control group. These findings underscore the positive impact of a collaborative writing intervention improved by AI feedback on specific aspects of writing.

  {"id":"wu2024a","abstract":"Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are gaining increasing popularity in education. Due to their increasing popularity, many empirical studies have been devoted to exploring the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. The proliferation of experimental studies has highlighted the need to summarize and synthesize the inconsistent findings about the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. However, few reviews focused on the meta-analysis of the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. The present study performed a meta-analysis of 24 randomized studies utilizing Stata software (version 14). The main goal of the current study was to meta-analytically examine the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes and the moderating effects of educational levels and intervention duration. The results indicated that AI chatbots had a large effect on students' learning outcomes. Moreover, AI chatbots had a greater effect on students in higher education, compared to those in primary education and secondary education. In addition, short interventions were found to have a stronger effect on students' learning outcomes than long interventions. It could be explained by the argument that the novelty effects of AI chatbots could improve learning outcomes in short interventions, but it has worn off in the long interventions. Future designers and educators should make attempt to increase students' learning outcomes by equipping AI chatbots with human-like avatars, gamification elements and emotional intelligence. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots have been gaining increasing popularity in education. Studies undertaken so far have provided conflicting evidence concerning the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. There has remained a paucity of meta-analyses synthesizing the contradictory findings about the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. What this paper adds This study, through meta-analysis, synthesized these recent findings about the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. This study found that AI chatbots could have a large effect on students' learning outcomes. This study found that the effects of AI chatbots were moderated by educational levels and intervention duration. Implications for practice and/or policy AI chatbot designers could make AI chatbots better by equipping AI chatbots with human-like avatars, gamification elements and emotional intelligence Practitioners and/or teachers should draw attention to the positive and negative effects of AI chatbots on students. Considering the importance of ChatGPT, more research is required to develop a better understanding of the effects of ChatGPT in education.

  {"id":"wu2024c","abstract":"Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle a wider range of complex tasks (e.g., coding, math) has drawn great attention from many researchers. As LLMs continue to evolve, merely increasing the number of model parameters yields diminishing performance improvements and heavy computational costs. Recently, OpenAI's o1 model has shown that inference strategies (i.e., Test-time Compute methods) can also significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, the mechanisms behind these methods are still unexplored. In our work, to investigate the reasoning patterns of o1, we compare o1 with existing Test-time Compute methods (BoN, Step-wise BoN, Agent Workflow, and Self-Refine) by using OpenAI's GPT-4o as a backbone on general reasoning benchmarks in three domains (i.e., math, coding, commonsense reasoning). Specifically, first, our experiments show that the o1 model has achieved the best performance on most datasets. Second, as for the methods of searching diverse responses (e.g., BoN), we find the reward models' capability and the search space both limit the upper boundary of these methods. Third, as for the methods that break the problem into many sub-problems, the Agent Workflow has achieved better performance than Step-wise BoN due to the domain-specific system prompt for planning better reasoning processes. Fourth, it is worth mentioning that we have summarized six reasoning patterns of o1, and provided a detailed analysis on several reasoning benchmarks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Siwei"},{"family":"Peng","given":"Zhongyuan"},{"family":"Du","given":"Xinrun"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Tuney"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Minghao"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Jialong"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Jiachen"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yizhi"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Jian"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Wangchunshu"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Qunshu"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Junbo"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Zhaoxiang"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Wenhao"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Ge"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Chenghua"},{"family":"Liu","given":"J.

Students receiving metacognitive feedback showed higher transfer scores, greater metacognitive sensitivity, and increased brain activation in the frontopolar area and middle temporal gyrus compared to other feedback types. Such activation correlated with metacognitive sensitivity. Students receiving affective feedback showed better retention scores than those receiving neutral feedback, along with higher activation in the supramarginal gyrus. Students receiving neutral feedback exhibited higher activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex than other feedback types.

  {"id":"zamfirescu-pereira2023","abstract":"Pre-trained large language models (“LLMs”) like GPT-3 can engage in fluent, multi-turn instruction-taking out-of-the-box, making them attractive materials for designing natural language interactions. Using natural language to steer LLM outputs (“prompting”) has emerged as an important design technique potentially accessible to non-AI-experts. Crafting effective prompts can be challenging, however, and prompt-based interactions are brittle. Here, we explore whether non-AI-experts can successfully engage in “end-user prompt engineering” using a design probe—a prototype LLM-based chatbot design tool supporting development and systematic evaluation of prompting strategies. Ultimately, our probe participants explored prompt designs opportunistically, not systematically, and struggled in ways echoing end-user programming systems and interactive machine learning systems. Expectations stemming from human-to-human instructional experiences, and a tendency to overgeneralize, were barriers to effective prompt design. These findings have implications for non-AI-expert-facing LLM-based tool design and for improving LLM-and-prompt literacy among programmers and the public, and present opportunities for further research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Zamfirescu-Pereira","given":"J.D."},{"family":"Wong","given":"Richmond Y."},{"family":"Hartmann","given":"Bjoern"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Qian"}],"citation-key":"zamfirescu-pereira2023","collection-title":"CHI '23","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2023 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","DOI":"10.1145/3544548.3581388","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-9421-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,19]]},"page":"1–21","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Why Johnny Can’t Prompt: How Non-AI Experts Try (and Fail) to Design LLM Prompts","title-short":"Why Johnny Can’t Prompt","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544548.3581388"},
  {"id":"zhang2025","abstract":"Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have demonstrated impressive mathematical reasoning capabilities, achieving near-perfect performance on benchmarks like GSM8K. However, their application in personalized education remains limited due to an overemphasis on correctness over error diagnosis and feedback generation. Current models fail to provide meaningful insights into the causes of student mistakes, limiting their utility in educational contexts. To address these challenges, we present three key contributions. First, we introduce \\textbf{MathCCS} (Mathematical Classification and Constructive Suggestions), a multi-modal benchmark designed for systematic error analysis and tailored feedback. MathCCS includes real-world problems, expert-annotated error categories, and longitudinal student data. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models, including \\textit{Qwen2-VL}, \\textit{LLaVA-OV}, \\textit{Claude-3.5-Sonnet} and \\textit{GPT-4o}, reveal that none achieved classification accuracy above 30\\% or generated high-quality suggestions (average scores below 4/10), highlighting a significant gap from human-level performance. Second, we develop a sequential error analysis framework that leverages historical data to track trends and improve diagnostic precision. Finally, we propose a multi-agent collaborative framework that combines a Time Series Agent for historical analysis and an MLLM Agent for real-time refinement, enhancing error classification and feedback generation. Together, these contributions provide a robust platform for advancing personalized education, bridging the gap between current AI capabilities and the demands of real-world teaching.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yi-Fan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Hang"},{"family":"Song","given":"Dingjie"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Lichao"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Tianlong"},{"family":"Wen","given":"Qingsong"}],"citation-key":"zhang2025","DOI":"10.48550/ARXIV.2502.13789","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025"]]},"license":"arXiv.org perpetual, non-exclusive license","note":"2 citations (Semantic Scholar/DOI) [2025-04-22]","publisher":"arXiv","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"From Correctness to Comprehension: AI Agents for Personalized Error Diagnosis in Education","title-short":"From Correctness to Comprehension","type":"article","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13789","version":"1"},
